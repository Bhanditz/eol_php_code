<de_description><![CDATA[Benson, 1966, p. 342-344; pl. 23, fig. 15; text-fig. 22:

Acrobotrissa cribosa Popofsky

Acrobotrissa cribosa Popofsky, 1913, Deutsche Südpolar-Exped., vol.14, p. 322, text fig. 29.

	A small rounded cephalis, partly within test cavity, surrounded by four lobes--a lateral triangular lobe on either side of it, a small ventral lobe with a latticed ventral tube (in most specimens tube not distinguishable), and a large, inflated dorsal lobe (text-fig. 22).  All lobes separated by constriction coincident with ribs.  A small, subcylindrical thorax with a slightly constricted mouth is present; a hyaline peristome present in several specimens.  Surface of test smooth except for a few short thorns on the rim of the ventral tube.  Pores of cephalic lobes and thorax of similar size, about as wide as the intervening bars, circular, subregularly arranged.  Internal structure illustrated in text-fig. 22A.  A distinct collar ring with cardinal and cervical pores present at base of latticed cephalis but separated from cephalis by large pores.  Primary lateral bars extend as short ribs in the thoracic wall and terminate in short spines.  Dorsal bar terminates in a short spine arising from the constriction between the dorsal cephalic lobe and the thorax, whereas the secondary lateral bars terminate at this constriction.  A long (35 µm), thin, crooked axial spine present in a few tests.  A short, thin, conical vertical spine present within the test cavity.  Apical bar free above median bar, becomes a dorsal rib of the latticed cephalis above this, and extends as an internal columella within the dorsal cephalic lobe but pierces this lobe and continues as a short, thin, conical apical spine.

	Measurements; based on 5 specimens from stations 60, 191, and 192: length of test 98-108 µm, of dorsal lobe 34-80 µm, of cephalis 21-25 µm; breadth of dorsal lobe 26-46 µm, of thorax 43-66 µm; length of apical spine 6-22 µm, of dorsal and primary lateral spine 6-10 µm.
	
Remarks.  This species is identical with Popofsky's (1913, text fig. 29) illustration of Acrobotrissa cribosa.  It is similar to Botryopyle dictyocephalus Haeckel (1887, p. 1113, Pl. 96, fig. 6) but has a ventral tube.  Investigation of Haeckel's type material of this species may reveal that it is conspecific with A. cribosa Popofsky.

Distribution. This species is rare in the Gulf with more general occurrence in the southern half of the Gulf than in the northern half.  In the southern Gulf it is present at stations 27, 34, 46, 56, 60, 71, 81, 92, and 93.  In the northern Gulf it is present only at stations 191 and 192, both located within the diatomite facies.  Its absence nearshore and its general occurrence in the southern Gulf indicates its affinity for oceanic waters.  Its presence in the northern Gulf may be related to upwelling.  Its absence between these two regions of the Gulf may be explained by its generally rare occurrence in the Gulf.  If more stations were sampled its presence in this region may be revealed.
	Popofsky (1913, p. 322) reported A. cribosa from the tropical Atlantic.  It has not been reported from high latitudes and, therefore, is cosmopolitan in tropical seas.

Inner shell spherical or subspherical, with very small roundish pores, quite irregularly scattered one-fourth to three-fourth as broad as their bars. Ten to twenty pores in the half meridian of the shell. From its surface arise in an extremely irregular and variable manner numerous oblique spines, often curved, often lamellar, and perforated by pores, sometimes hollow, fenestrated cones. At different distances from the surface these spines send out lateral curved branches, which by communication form the delicate and very irregular network of the outer shell. This network is often incomplete and very unlike that or the inner shell, with large polygonal meshes, six to eighteen in the half meridian of the shell. Surface of the outer shell covered with numerous small, curved, and oblique spines, prolongations of the inner spines, but scarcely one-third to one-half as long as these. The radius of the inner shell bears to that of the outer a ration= 3:4.

Dimensions: Diameter of the inner shell 0.08 to 0.12, of the outer 0.11 to 0.15; pores of the inner shell 0.001 to 0.009, of the outer 0.01 to 0.04; length of the outer spines 0.005 to 0.009.

<de_description><![CDATA[Echinomma leptodermum:
The outer ball thin-walled (the walls broader than they are thick). The pores polygonally roundish oval, very uneven in size, 7-25 microns, with intermediate walls (2-4 microns broad), which are much broader towards the corners (lumen rounded off). 

The middle shell moderately thick (the intermediate walls being as thick as they are wide, about 1 1/2 microns), rather angular and irregular, a little larger than in Hexacontium enthacanthum; diameter about 40 microns. The pores are somewhat uneven, roundish, 4-7 microns. The intermediate walls solid, not particularly broader in the corners. 

It is difficult to see the inmost shell, which possesses solid beams (about equal in thickness to those of the middle shell), but rather few polygonal, mostly pentagonal or hexagonal pores, about 8 microns. The diameter of the inmost shell about 15 microns (or a little more). 

About 15 main spines, about equally broad inside as outside of the outmost shell, not long. They seldom protrude farther than to a length equal to the distance between the two outer shells, often less, and vary in development. Between the two inner shells, the radial spines are very narrow and in fact hardly wider than the beams of the inmost shell. 

The byspines on the outside shell are in appearance like the main spines, but not radially lengthened inwards, with a wide base on the outer shell (like the main spines) and very unevenly developed in size, although generally protruding less than the main spines. Variable in number; although, as a rule, not many, far from being developed in all the corners, only here and there. 

The number of the main spines is variable often only about 10, though oftenest about 15. They are 3-edged as in Hexacontium pachydermum.

As in Hexacontium pachydermum and H. enthacanthum, there are forms without outer shells, but there is generally a trace of these in transverse processes on the main spines. These may, however, also be entirely absent. Such forms, of which one is illustrated on pl. VIII f. 33c, might equally well be reckoned as belonging to the genus Actinomma (without byspines on the third shell), respectively Haliomma (with only two shells), if their dimensions and other characteristics were not completely corresponding to the above species. Cfr. Jörgensen 1. c. p. 58.  

This species also varies a good deal. When the outside shell is thin-walled, the pores and intermediate walls are of a more uneven size. The byspines are in such cases slightly developed or (as yet) wanting. It is likely that these divergences may be accounted for by a difference in age. A more important difference is the number of main spines, which seems to be able to vary from 10 to 16. Comparatively frequent, though, like all radiolarian with us, always present in small numbers. It occurs, however, decidedly more frequent and in larger numbers than the two Hexacontium species.

Distribution: The same as that of Hexacontium enthacanthum and H. pachydermum. Frequent also on the west coast of Norway and in the Norwegian Sea.]]></de_description>

Owing to the thickness of the cortical shell, the interior shells were visible merely as faint shadows, so I am not quite convinced whether the shells are 3 or 2. If the latter be the case, the species belongs to Haliomma and is then nearest akin to H. horrida.

Central chamber about twice as broad and as high as both cupolas.  On the surface quite symmetrically distributed twenty long and strong cylindrical radial spines; eight in the sagittal plane or in the meridan plane of the central chamber (four opposite in pairs in the principal and sagittal axes, four others in the middle between the principal and sagittal spines); four in the horizontal transverse plane, on both sides of the poles of the major or lateral axis; and eight in diagonal planes (corresponding to the eight wing-spines of Tetrapyle octacantha).  In the centre of the central chamber is a distinct trizonal medullary shell like that of Tetrapyle,  with two vertical columella beams.  Pores of the cortical shell subregular, circular, with elevated hexagonal frames about four times as broad as the bars; five to seven in the semicircle of one cupola.  (This remarkable species differs from Tholartus vicenus in the possession of a medullary shell, from Amphitholniun acanthometra by the simple cortical shell.  Copare these species)

Dimensions.Major axis of the shell 0.14 to 0.16, minor axis 0.10 to 0.12;  pores 0.015, bars 0.004; major axis of the medullary shell 0.04 to 0.05, minor (horizontal) axis 0.02 to 0.03; length of the twenty radial spines 0.18 to 0.24, basal breadth 0.01.

<de_description><![CDATA[Androcyclas gamphonycha:
The region of the neck is very peculiar, not forming any distinct stricture between the cephalis and thorax, but a zone where these two joints gradually pass into each other. This region appears on the dorsal side to lie between two pair of branches from the apical spine, D, namely two dorsal, lateral spines below (corresponding to those in the genus Amphimelissa) and the primary, lateral arches above. These dorsal, lateral spines (from the base of the spine A and the spine D) lie near the hind wall of the cephalis. The lower part of the apical spine, D, is here a columella in the region of the neck, but lying near the cephalic wall.
	
The length of the abdomen varies considerably, probably according to age; this is also the case with the number of byspines. It is not unusual to find comparatively well developed forms which are apparently almost or entirely without the characteristic byspines, but which in other respects diverge so little from the typical forms that they can scarcely be considered to belong to any other species. Therefore I now think that Pterocorys theoconus must be looked upon as a form of this species.
	
The other, very short tophorn is very rarely seen distinctly and is probably a more or less accidental formation. Sometimes strong siliceous edgings are developed on the upper part of the cephalis, and these may be protruding and in certain positions look like a very broad, short spine.
	
According to my experience no limit either can be drawn between Pterocorys gamphonyxos and P. amblycephalis. The younger forms seem to answer best to the latter, which is in appearance so different to P. gamphonyxos that it is generally easy to keep them distinct. (This is done in the tables). The principal difference is that P. amblycephalis has a cephalis which is at the upper part abruptly cut off and, at the very top, often open. This opening is probably closed later on. The tophorn is generally shorter and more weakly developed and the abdomen short and broad, without distinct byspines, all characteristics which may be explained by supposing that P. amblycephalis is the younger stage of development. On individuals which it seemed more correct to refer to P. amblycephalis than to P. gamphonyxos, I have also occasionally seen short and broad byspines in conjunction with a better development of the abdomen.
	
On the best developed specimens of A. gamphonycha, the abdomen is again narrowed below, the strongest set of spines being on that part which is broadest. The byspines are only slightly bent.
	
Frequent, in Tranødybet 6/4-1899, 0-630 m., numerous, otherwise rather sparse and generally only in deep water.
	
Distribution: On the west coast of Norway, in deep water, rare. Off the coast of Finmark 5/3-1901, in a surface sample (S/S Michael Sars cfr. Gran, 1902, p. 154). Perhaps a temperate oceanic form.

<de_description><![CDATA[Benson, 1966, p. 170-171; pl. 5, figs. 10-11:

Anomalacantha dentata (Mast)

Heteracantha dentata Mast, 1910, Deutsche Tiefsee-Exped., vol. 19, no. 4, p. 159, P1. 37, fig. 47.
Cladococcus lychnosphaera Hollande and Enjumet, 1960, Paris, Mus. Nat. dHist. Natur., Archives, vol. 7, ser. 7, p. 115, P1. 55, figs. 1, 2.

	Small, spherical, latticed shell from which originate 8-12 or more long, broad, regularly arranged, three-bladed radial spines, each with thorns or lateral branches originating from the blades at 2-5 or more verticils.  Pores of shell circular, of equal size, 5-6 on half the shell circumference, surrounded by well-defined, hexagonal frames.  Surface of shell either smooth, thorny, or with thin, conical, often distally forked, secondary spines of variable length (up to 25 µm), all originating singly from the nodes of the intervening bars.  In fully developed tests a verticil of long, arborescently branched lateral spines is present on each main spine.  All verticils at a common distance from the center of the test.  The lateral, arborescent branches do not anastomose with those of adjacent main spines; therefore, an outer shell is not developed.

	Measurements: based on 30 specimens from stations 81, 191, and 192: diameter of shell 53-69 µm, length of radial spines 166-246 µm, breadth at their bases 6-12 µm.

	Remarks. There is no essential difference between the Gulf species and Cladococcus lychnosphaera Hollande and Enjumet.  The only difference of note is the variable number of verticils of lateral branches on the radial spines of the Gulf specimens.  The genus Cladococcus Müller (1856, p. 485) is defined as having all spines similar, but in the Gulf specimens as well as in the illustrations of C. lychnosphaera (Hollande and Enjumet, 1960, P1. 55, figs. 1, 2) there are branched or unbranched, thin, conical by-spines in addition to the radial main spines; this species, therefore, should be placed in the genus Anomalacantha Loeblich and Tappan [= Heteracantha Mast].  Heteracantha dentata Mast differs from the Gulf species only in the lack of relatively large arborescent branches which arise from the rnain spines at a common level.  This feature is characteristic only of fully developed individuals.  The majority of the specimens from the Gulf are identical with Mast's species.

	Distribution. This species is nearly cosmopolitan in the Gulf and undergoes a marked increase in frequency in the northern half of the Gulf.  It is very rare at the few southern Gulf stations where it is present, namely 34, 56, 81, 91, 92, 93, 95, and 99.  North of this region it is present at all stations except 203 and 214.  It is rare at all stations except 151 (2.6%), l84 (2.8%), 192 (2.4%), and 206 (2.4%) where it is common.  In general its frequency is highest at stations located within or near the diatomite facies; therefore, its distribution in the northern Gulf is influenced by upwelling.  Its higher frequency in the northern Gulf also suggests its greater tolerance for waters with higher than average temperature and salinity.  Its distribution in the southern Gulf does not appear to be related to upwelling in this region.
	This species is widespread in Recent tropical seas.  Heteracantha dentata Mast was reported from the tropical Atlantic in the region of the Canary Islands.  Cladococcus lychnosphaera Hollande and Enjumet was reported from the Mediterranean Sea in the Bay of Algiers.

<de_description><![CDATA[Acanthocorys umbellifera:
Under this name I have entered a form which has the appearance of a species of the division Dicyrtida, but is certainly not fully developed. It is remarkable, as also Haeckels illustration, for a rather large cephalis and a short, broad thorax. The spines in the thorax, protruding from the free brim like long, fine spikes are characteristic. Some of these spines are weaker than the others and are branches of them. The cephalis is well supplied with long, needleshaped byspines. There is also a similar apical spine, which here, as in Lithomelissa, is the spine D and runs in the wall of the cephalis, thus not forming any inner columella.
	
My species differs from Haeckels only in the want of byspines on the thorax.
	
This species occurred very rarely and sparsely in the material from the northern coasts of Norway: 19/1 1899, 40 miles NW of Gaukværø, 0-700 m; 29/1 1899, Malangen, 0-300 m.
	
Distribution: More frequent on the west coast of Norway, numerous in the Oster Fiord, near Bergen, at a great depth (up to 600 m), 13/6 1900.
	
Cleve mentions the species from a few places in the Atlantic, west of Ireland and more to the south, as well as from several places far north, to the north west point of Spitzbergen. In these northern places, the species was only found in deep water. Haeckel mentions it from the Azores and the Mediterranean. Hence Cleve considers the species to belong to Styliplankton. It seems, however, judging from the places mentioned where it has been found, to have about the same distribution as Plectacantha, and is probably boreal oceanic.
	
It is, however, quite possible that Haeckels is a distinct species. ]]></de_description>

<de_description><![CDATA[Arachnosphaera dichotoma (p. 60-61):
Poren der Gitterkugel rundlich, 0.012 bis 0.015 mm breit, wegen hervorstehender, ziemlich dicker Wandungen hexagonal (selten pentagonal) umrahmt. 

Radialstacheln 15 (selten 14 bis 16), dreischmeidig, ziemlich gleichbreit, gegen die Spitze verschmälert, am Grunde 0.003 bis 0.004 mm breit. Jeder Stachel trägt 1 bis 3 Wirtel von drei (selten vier) rechtwinklig abstehenden Seitenästen, deren jeder wiederholt gabelig verästelt ist. Die feinsten dieser Aestchen bilden mit einander eine zarte äussere Kugel. Es entstehen in dieser Weise 1 bis 3, mehr oder weniger unvollständige äussere Kugeln, von denen übrigens meistens nur die innere ziemlich vollständig ist.

An jeder Schneide der Radialstacheln finden sich über den erwähnten Wirteln 1 bis 2 (selten 3) Wirtel rechtwinklig ausgesperrter Dorne, die einfach (oder die untersten ein wenig gabelig verästelt) sind und gegen die Spitze der Radialstacheln allmählich kürzer werden. Die (innerste, vollständige) Gitterkugel trägt in jeder Maschenecke einen sehr feinen, ziemlich langen Nebenstachel, der oben zweimal gabeltheilig ist. Bisweilen sind einige dieser Stacheln oben mit einander verbunden.

Durchmesser der innersten Kugel 0.060mm. Länge der Radialstacheln variabel, 0.100 bis 0.140 mm. Diameter der zweiten (sehr oft unvollständigen) Gitterschale am häufigsten ungefähr 0.140 mm, bisweilen kleiner. Mitunter findet man Individuen mit nur zwei Wirteln an jedem Radialstachel. Der obere besteht dann aus drei einfachen Dornen, der untere aus mehrmals gabeltheiligen Stacheln, die jedoch keine zusammenhängende Gitterschale bilden. Auch findet man (junge?) Individuen mit kürzeren Radialstacheln, die nur einen Wirtel von Aesten, die gabelig oder selten einfach sind, besitzen. Da aber in allen Fällen die innere Kugel mit den characteristischen Nebenstacheln dieselbe ist, habe ich in diesen abweichenden Formen nur dieselbe Art erblicken können. 

Nicht selten, immer spärlich vorkommend: April-Juni, August-November.]]></de_description>

<de_description><![CDATA[Artostrobus jörgenseni:
Skeleton consisting of two segments. First segment small, sometimes with small rounded pores on its surface, sometimes apex completely lacks pores. At point of junction of first and second segments irregular swellings seen, but junction simple, wall of "cephalis" passing directly into wall of second segment. In this section of shell pores scattered irregularly. On following part of second segment pores rounded or oval, often extending in direction perpendicular to axis of shell; grouped in distinct transverse rows. Second segment with irregular outline, expanding slightly downwards. Internal skeleton composed of slender, well developed needles MB. D, Lr and Ll, A and Vert. Needle A forming apical horn and needles D, Lr and Ll forming lateral processes of slender (often broken off). 

Dimensions: length of first segment 12-15µm, width about 20µm, length of second segment up to 90µm, width (below) 45-50µm.

Note: This species is similar to Artostrobus annulatus. In both shells is elongate, the ratio of the first and second segment the same as is their function; pores in both disposed in transverse rows. Basic difference between our species and A. annulatus is the presence in A. jörgenseni of pores in the upper part of the shell (first segment and region of junction with second), absent in A. annulatus, and the larger and denser pores on the second segment of A. jörgenseni than on that of A. annulatus. In addition, the second segment itself expands markedly inferiorly. The elements of the internal skeleton are more developed than in A. annulatus. However, these differences are not great and our species may be related to genus Artostrobus, as it is similar to A. annulatus, the type species of the genus.

Callimitra emmae Haeckel

Callimitra emmae Haeckel, 1887, Challenger Rept., Zool., vol. 18, p. 1218, Pl. 63, figs. 3, 4.

	Cephalis helmet-shaped with a pointed apex, smooth, with unequal, subpolygonal to subrectangular pores; separated from the pyramidal thorax by a distinct contour change and indistinct collar stricture.  Thorax developed between the three, straight, divergent, three-bladed dorsal and primary lateral feet and constructed of a delicate network of thin, secondary bars that originate from the feet and from two to three or more heavier but thin, primary bars that extend at approximate right angles to each foot from each of the two lower blades of the feet; the primary bars between adjacent feet intersect distally; the secondary bars are oriented predominantly in two directions--parallel to the primary bars and transversely; therefore, they separate small, unequal, predominantly triangular to trapezoidal pores.  The basal margin of the thorax is convex downward between adjacent feet.  A similar lattice consisting of primary and secondary bars, comprises three, large, planar keels, each of which is developed between one of the blades of the three-bladed apical horn and the upper blade of the basal feet.  The keels are separated by equal angles; their lateral margins are convex outward with a curve similar to one side of a spherical triangle.  The primary bars of their lattice originate from the blades of the apical horn and the outer blade of each foot as well as from thin ribs in the wall of the cephalis, two of which correspond to the apical-lateral arches, and one of which lies in the sagittal plane; the primary bars intersect distally.  The secondary bars are approximately parallel to the primary bars and to the outer curved margin of each keel; therefore, they separate unequal, triangular, trapezoidal, and rhombic pores.  Four large collar pores present; cardinal pores are of type A; a distinct collar ring occupies the base of the latticed cephalis.  The apical bar is an internal, nearly centrally located columella. The vertical spine is a short thorn.

	Measurements; based on two specimens from stations 81 and 115: height of cephalis 42-47 µm; length of thorax 86-87 µm; breadth of cephalis 52-58 µm, of thorax 181-221 µm; length of apical horn 75-76 µm, of basal feet 89-105 µm.

	Distribution.  This species is very rare in the Gulf.  It is present at stations 34, 81, 93, 106, and 115.  It is, therefore, an oceanic species with little affinity for Gulf waters.
	Haeckel (1887, p. 1218) reported this species from the central Pacific at "Challenger" station 272.  It is apparently a tropical species because it has not been reported from high latitudes.

<de_description><![CDATA[Campylacantha cladophora:
The sagittal, basal spine is best developed, very strong, long, strongly bent, gradually narrowing off into a long fine point, like all the strong main spines and branches three-edged. One edge is dorsal, the others lateral. On these three edges, there are strong, expanded, narrow pointed branches, several in a row along the same edge, rather scattered and not clearly forming verticils when compared to the branches on the other edges. The branches become short towards the end of the main spines. The larger branches are in their turn furnished with similar squarrose branches. 

The basal, lateral spines are also strongly developed, although not quite so much as the sagittal, dorsal one, in other respects corresponding precisely in form and arrangement of branches. 

The apical spine is much less developed, having only a verticil of three branches on the corresponding place to the verticil of Plagiacantha, outside this being thin and unbranched. The ventral,  
     
The vertical, sagittal spine is thin and unbranched, almost straight, pointing obliquely downwards between the lateral spines and being somewhat shorter than these.

In addition, in well developed forms, there appears to be two strong, lateral arched branches extending form the basal, dorsal spine at the base of the apical spine. These arched branches from a pair of secondary, lateral spines, L(r) and L(l), in form and arrangement of branches corresponding to the primary, lateral spines, only less developed. In those individuals where a smaller number of secondary spines were developed, they were not visible. But it must be remarked that the species is very brittle, so that the branches are easily broken off.

This species is especially interesting, as it seems to show the evolution of the ring species. Cfr. above and under the following species.

Rare, always in small numbers, only in deeper water samples. Seems to be boreal oceanic.

Distribution: Otherwise only observed on the west coast of Norway, Oster Fiord, very scarse, in deep water.]]></de_description>

<de_description><![CDATA[Helotholus:
The four primary spines with the ventral, sagittal one. All five protrude as single spikes, the dorsal one, A, down on the thorax, the ventral, sagittal one in the neck stricture, the one marked D, on the cephalis as an apical spine.

The lower part of this latter spine is inside the wall of the cephalis, while it a little higher up runs in the very wall. It is therefore no genuine columella.

There is also an axial spine, as in the other species here mentioned of the Cyrtoidea group. This axial spine starts as usual from the ventral end of the central rod, in the interior of the lattice shell, a little below the neck stricture, and is in elder individuals of Helotholus histricosa divided in two.

The thorax is broadly campanulate, nearly semispherical.

Helotholus histricosa:
The ventral sagittal spine about equal in strength to the others and is directed a little upwards. The primary, lateral spines are nearly horizontal, bent slightly downwards; they protrude at the neck stricture, rather far up. The dorsal spine, A, is directed downwards and pierces the thorax rather far down.
	
Only the dorsal spine, A, runs for a short distance in the very wall of the thorax, the others pierce only the wall.
	
The cephalis is semispherical, or a little higher, in cross section circular. The thorax is broadly campanulate.
	
The pores are irregular in shape and size, most of them being roundish or oblong, smallest on the cephalis (1-16µ), largest on the thorax, especially down below on young individuals. Here the brim of the thorax is furnished with numerous, irregularly placed, short spines, which are not true byspines, but only the walls of meshes which are not yet developed.
	
On the cephalis and thorax, narrow needle shaped byspines are scattered, the longest being about equal in length to the diameter of the cephalis.
	
I have not seen any individuals which could be supposed to be fully developed. The species does not answer well to any of Haeckels genera. From the genus Lithomelissa, as I have understood it in the species L. setosa, there are such important differences that it does not seem reasonable to place these two forms in the same genus. It might rather be united with the following species. I have not, however, done so, more especially as the definition of Haeckels genus Dictyophimus requires that there should be three thoracic ribs which are lengthened out to basal feet, and this definition may at a pinch be made to apply to the two following species, but not at all to Helotholus histricosa.

Rather rare, sparse, in deep water samples.

Distribution: Seems also to be a boreal, oceanic species.]]></de_description>

<de_description><![CDATA[Ceratospyris hyperborea:
I have only seen very few individuals of this species. Its structure seems to be of precisely the same type as that of Dictyocircus clathratus, only that, on both sides of the sagittal ring, there is a further development of the net work, which has become two complete domes, one on each side. 

The primary pores (nearest the sagittal ring) are polygonal, the others being irregular roundish and oblong and varying considerably in size. The separating walls are strong, with here and there narrow, protruding points which form obliquely diverging narrow spines. There is also a rather plentiful number of similar byspines. 

All the spines are little prominent, to 1/4-1/2 of the diameter of the sagittal ring. 

The species does not appear to be identical to any of Haeckel´s. 
Very rare and only singly: The Vestfjorden 1/2 1899, 0-200 m. 

Distribution: In warm, salt waters of the Atlantic beyond Søndmøre (S/S Michael Sars, 2/2 1901, between station 4 and 5, in the surface; cfr. Gran, 1902, p. 149), very sparsely; the Oster Fjord near Bergen, at a great depth, here too only singly.]]></de_description>

Elaphococcus cervicornis Haeckel

Elaphococcus gaussi Popof sky, l9l2, Deutsche Südpolar-Exped., vol. 13, pp. 100-101, P1. 6, fig. 1.

	Single spherical shell with 20-40 long, dichotomously branched, cylindrical, regularly arranged, radial spines arising from its surface.  Surface of shell with a few scattered, thin, conical by-spines (6-25 µm) or thorns arising from the intervening bars.  Pores of shell subequal, subcircular, subpolygonal, or subelliptical, with subregular (hexagonal) arrangement, separated by relatively thin, smooth to spinose, intervening bars, without polygonal frames, 8-11 on the half circumference.  At least three of four orders of branches of the radial spines were observed.

	Measurements; based on 6 specimens from stations 91, 92, and 133: diameter of shell 84-96 µm, of imaginary sphere tangent to tips of radial spines 155-246 µm; length of radial spines 43-135 µm

	Remarks. No specimens from the Gulf were observed with as many orders of branching of the radial spines (6) as shown in Haeckel's illustration of Cladococcus cervicornis Haeckel (1862, P1. 14, figs. 4, 6), but the Gulf specimens are probably not fully developed.  Popofsky's illustration of E. gaussi Popofsky (1912, P1. 6, fig. 1) differs from the majority of the Gulf specimens in the presence of low, knob-like thorns on the intervening bars.  This feature is variable within the species from the Gulf.

	Distribution.  This species occurs very rarely and at only four stations in the Gulf, namely 91, 93, 106, and 133.  Whether or not its presence at these stations is a result of a response to upwelling cannot be determined.  Due to its apparently low frequency in waters of the Gulf, any record if its occurrence in the sediments of the Gulf is an accident of sampling.
	Haeckel (1887, p. 228) states that this species is present at the surface in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans as well as in the Mediterranean Sea.  It is apparently confined to tropical seas because it has not been reported from high latitudes.

<de_description><![CDATA[Cladoscenium limbatum:
Resemble to some extent the foregoing species [Cladoscenium tricolpium], and is, on the whole, of the same structure, but, but is nevertheless, quite different through the following special characteristics: The main spines are more broadly three-edged, each edge having 2 to 4 diverging spines, which nearest to the shell are often prolongated to arch-shaped fine, supporting branches, between the shell and the main spines. Such arches are only seen from the one or two innermost branches (spines) and most clearly on the upper side of the main spines. Outside the basal arches, perhaps only between the lateral spines, a brim-shaped continuation of the lattice shell is developed. This brim continues a little way forwards along the side of the main spines.

There is a verticil of branches high up on the columella, as in the foregoing species, but these branches are here almost straight on the distance between the columella and the shell. 

The network of the lattice shell is much more perfect than in the foregoing species, most of the meshes being small and more or less distinctly square. 

There is a trace of lattice wings from the top horn to the basal spines, and for this reason the species, perhaps, should most correctly be referred to the genus Pteroscenium HCK. 

The cephalis is 52 µ in height, the width between the lateral spines 56 µ. The right, lateral spine is 68 µ in length outside the shell, the tophorn 50 µ. The stronger, primary arches seem here to become less conspicuous with growing age, so as to make the network more even in development. Finally the pores seem to disappear, being closed by thin plates, so that they are transformed into windows, not openings.

<de_description><![CDATA[Cladoscenium tricolpium:
Here again we have the four primary spines and the ventral sagittal one. The almost central columella corresponds to the basal, dorsal spine, D, in Plectacantha oikiskos and Phormacantha hystrix. On the other hand, the connection with Protoscenium simplex is evident.

From two, somewhat upwards pointing, branches from each of the left and right lateral spine four arches extend upwards and unite in twos (those from the same main spine) to form a strong apical arch. These are the corresponding arches in Protoscenium simplex, where they connect the branches of the lateral spines with the corresponding two branches of the apical one (D). The tips of these branches have disappeared in Cladoscenium, and the arches pass gradually into the branches. The two corresponding ones in the dorsal spine (A) are also found; but one of them is not particularly conspicuous as there are several similar secondary arches.

The lattice shell (cfr. Jørgensen 1. c. p. 78) is particularly perfect between the apical spine (D) and the ventral, sagittal one.

There are, where the main spines protrude, rather large triangular meshes formed by connecting beams between the larger arches of the shell and the spines, two at the dorsal spine (A) and the left, lateral spine (Lr), three at the apical spine (D). It is only in older individuals that the long, fine downhanging spines are formed on the basal arches (i. e. the arches between the basal spines, A, Lr and Ll).

There does not seem to be anything of importance to prevent us from considering this species to be identical to Euscenium tricolpium HCK. It is true that, in Haeckels illustration, the distinct, ventral, sagittal spine is not present. There are, however, so many details in the illustration, which answer remarkably well to this species that it is highly probable that they are identical. The reason why Haeckel refers the species to the genus Euscenium, is that he considers the shell to be closed by the strong apical arches, (which are conspicuous in certain sightings of the microscope) while it really extends farther up along the apical spine, to the three connecting beams above mentioned.

My opinion therefore is still that the species is a Cladoscenium. Haeckel mentions the completely corresponding upper arches in Cladoscenium pectinatum HCK. (L. 86, p. 1150, pl. 98, f. 2), as a second verticil of branches of the columella.

Frequent, always in small numbers, in deep water, up to 100 m.

Distribution: Not rare on the west coast of Norway, here too sparse, and only in deep water samples. Was found in surface samples from the warmer and salter Atlantic waters 2/2 1901, in the sea beyond Sundmøre, 13/2 off Lofoten and 5/3 off Finmarken
(cfr. Gran L. 70, pp. 150, 151, 154). Mentioned by Haeckel from a great depth in the Central Pacific. Cleve has found the species at a great depth west of Spitzbergen and at some places in the northern and north western parts of the Atlantic. Cleve (L. 40, p. 161) remarks that the species, though often found together with Styliplankton (temperate oceanic), does not, however, appear to be a Styliplankton form. Cleve considers it likely, either that it comes from the northern polar basin, or from the Northern Pacific, p. 128.]]></de_description>

?Clathrocanium coronatum Popofsky, 1913, Deutsche Südpolar-Exped., vol. 14, pp. 342-343, Pl. 33, fig. 1.

	Cephalis dome-shaped to globular; with short, thin, conical spines scattered over its surface; with small, subequal but irregularly shaped pores; with ribs in its wall the same as in Callimitra emmae and Clathrocorys murrayi; four collar pores present at its base.  Vertical bar thin, extends as a short, thin, three-bladed to conical vertical spine.  Apical bar a central columella, extends as a centrally located, three-bladed apical spine.  The dorsal and primary lateral feet originate from the distinct collar ring, are straight, relatively stout but short, three-bladed, and broadly divergent.  Thorax with three large gates each between adjacent feet; the distal margins of the gates defined by convex downward arched bars developed between adjacent feet.  Lattice of the thorax consists of relatively small, unequal, circular to subcircular pores and is developed between three closely spaced, parallel, arched bars including the first arch mentioned above.  The second arched bar originates from the feet near their distal terminations as spines; it is located downward and outward a short distance from the first arched bar.  The third arched bar, which does not originate from the feet, is located downward but inward a short distance from the second; all three of the third arches are joined by short, horizontal bars, each located below each foot.  Between the feet the thorax, therefore, consists of a convex downward, arched lattice, L-shaped in section; the two sides of the "L" are latticed and meet at an angle that points outward.  Below each foot the thorax consists of a convex outward, triangular lattice whose sides are defined by the proximal portions of adjacent second arches and the horizontal bar joining the adjacent third arched bars.  In two specimens only a small portion of the keels present between the apical horn and each foot was observed; in all other tests the only suggestion of their presence is branches originating from the blades of the apical horn and the outer blade of each foot. 

	Measurements; based on 4 specimens from stations 81 and 115: height of cephalis 28-44 µm; length of thorax 49-65 µm; breadth of cephalis 37-52 µm, of thorax 90-98 µm; length of apical horn 32-53 µm, of feet 49-76 µm.

	Remarks.  The incompletely developed keels between the apical horn and feet were observed with large proximal gates or pores, not unlike those of Clathrocorys murrayi Haeckel from the Gulf.  Popofsky's (1913, Pl. 33, fig. 1) illustration of Clathrocanium coronatum Popofsky shows incompletely developed keels which are the same as those present in the Gulf specimens.  His species differs from the Gulf species only in the presence of polygonal frames surrounding the pores of the cephalis.  This feature was not observed in the Gulf specimens but may be an intraspecific variation.  This species is very rare in the Gulf sediments; consequently, its complete range of variation was not determined.  C. ornatum Popofsky (1913,  pp. 343-344, Pl. 33, fig. 2) differs from C. coronatum in the presence of apparently a different type of keel.  Popofsky's illustration of the former is of an incompletely developed specimen; therefore, the true structure of the keel is unknown.

	Distribution.  Specimens identified as C. cf. coronatum Popofsky are very rare in the Gulf, being present only at stations 34, 56, 60, 64, 71, 81, 91, 92, 93, 106, 115, 133, and 184.  They are of more general occurrence in the southern half of the Gulf; therefore, this species has a greater affinity for oceanic than for Gulf waters.
	Popofsky (1913, p. 343) reported both C. coronatum and C. ornatum from the western tropical part of the Indian Ocean.  If the Gulf species is conspecific with the former of the two species, its apparent geographic range includes the tropical parts of the Pacific and Indian Oceans.  No other record of its occurrence was found.

Clathrocircus stapedius Haeckel

Clathrocircus stapedius Haeckel, 1887, Challenger Rept., Zool., vol. 18, p. 962, Pl. 92, fig. 8.

	Majority of tests not fully developed, consisting of the sagittal ring, a collar ring with cardinal and cervical pores, a lattice partially developed from the upper part of the superior bar of the sagittal ring and consisting of two pores on each side of this bar, and an elliptical meridional (frontal) ring, not three-bladed, lying in a plane perpendicular to the sagittal plane and containing the apical bar of the sagittal ring.  In most specimens a dorsally extending spine, generally parallel to the sagittal plane, arises from each of four points on the meridional ring, at the upper and lower lateral points of each half of the ring; these spines are branched distally, in one specimen the branches from the upper spine of each half-ring are joined to form an elliptical ring lying in the horizontal plane, resembling a dorsal "handle" (Pl. 21, fig. 13).  A few tests were observed, particularly at stations located within the diatomite facies in the Gulf, with bilocular cephalis completely latticed except for the dorsal face; pores of lattice unequal, irregular, relatively large (Pl. 22, figs. 1-2).  Sagittal ring approximately D-shaped, with thin bars three-bladed except for a short, horizontal, cylindrical median bar and a thin, cylindrical, ventrally ascending vertical bar.  Cardinal pores subtrapezoidal, larger than the subtriangular cervical pores; jugular pores represented by a pair of small circular pores which pierce the broad, planar, proximal portion of the thin, conical dorsal spine and are divided by the dorsal bar that extends as this spine; jugular pores, therefore, technically not a part of the collar ring.  Primary lateral bars thin, conical, extend beyond collar ring as spines with sub-distal ascending branches which form a complete or incomplete ring, similar to the frontal ring: the ring joins with the lattice on either side of the superior bar and has secondary spines arising from it and representing an incomplete lattice; this ring generally not distinguishable as a distinct rib in completely latticed tests.  A thin, conical vertical spine of variable length extends from and is collinear with vertical bar.  Apical spine thin, conical, of variable length, extending from and collinear with the straight, vertical apical bar; a pair of laterally ascending spines arises from its base, their proximal portions representing intervening bars in the upper lattice. Surface of lattice in completely developed tests with a few scattered, thin, conical by-spines.

	Measurements; based on 41 specimens from stations 27, 34, 60, 81, 92, 106, and 133: height of sagittal ring 31-46 µm, breadth 30-38 :m; breadth of meridional ring (lateral axis) 68-102 µm; breadth of latticed cephalis (1 specimen) 81 µm; length of apical spine 7-26 µm, of vertical spine 7-16 µm, of dorsal spine (portion beyond jugular pores) 9-33 µm.

	Remarks.  Haeckel's illustration of C1athrocircus stapedius Haeckel (1887, Pl. 92, fig. 8) does not differ from specimens present in the Gulf.  The meridional ring is incomplete, and the vertical spine is not shown, but the four collar pores and the jugular pores are the same as in the Gulf specimens.  The presence of the meridional or frontal ring is characteristic of the Superfamily Acanthodesmiacea, but the few tests with a completely latticed bilocular test are similar to the Triospyridicae, another example of the close relationship between these two superfamilies.

	Distribution.  The frequency of this species increases northward in the Gulf.  It is very rare at all of the southern Gulf stations except 93 where it is common; it is absent at stations 64 and 90. Its average frequency in the northern half of the Gulf is rare but greater than in the south, and it is common at two stations, 136 and 192, both located within the diatomite facies; it is absent at stations 130, 194, 203, 206 and 214.  Its northward increase may be explained by its response to upwelling.  This is indicated by its greater abundance at stations located within the diatomite facies.  It apparently does not respond to upwelling in the southern half of the Gulf.  Its absence or near absence from marginal stations indicates its preference for a more nearly oceanic habitat.
	Haeckel (1887, p. 962) reported this species from the central Pacific at "Challenger" station 271.  It has not been reported from high latitudes.

<de_description><![CDATA[Clathrocorys murrayi:
Cephalis pear-shaped, with irregularly square pores. From the centre of its base there arise four
strong, prismatic, radial beams of nearly equal size, the vertical, straight, cephalic horn being little
longer than the three divergent, somewhat curved feet. In the three meridional planes (between the
horn and each foot) a few rather thick branches arise, which by communication of the ramules form
the three vertical latticed wings; each wing with two large meshes, three to five meshes of medium size, and three to four parallel arachnoidal rows of small, square, distal meshes. The three walls of the flat pyramidal thorax (between every two feet) are formed in the upper part by squarish network similar to that of the cephalis, in the middle part by a single row of arches separated by thin threads, and in the lower part by a narrow band of arachnoidal network. Dedicated to Dr. John
Murray.

Dimensions.-Cephalis 0.05 long, 0.05 broad; thorax 0.04 long, 0.15 broad; apical distance of
every two feet 0.15, of each foot and the horn 0.17.
Habitat.-Central Pacific, Station 271, depth 2425 fathoms.

Clathromitra pterophormis Haeckel

Clathromitra pterophormis Haeckel, 1887, Challenger Rept., Zool, vol. 18, p. 1219, Pl. 57, fig. 8.

	Test consisting of a single, very large, conical joint corresponding to the cephalis.  Surface of test rough; lattice very irregular; an irregular double layer resembling a spongy structure, distally (not unlike the double cortical shell of Diploplegma banzare Riedel); proximally without outer 1ayer of lattice but with irregular, unequal pores.  Apical bar a centrally located, cylindrical columella with one or two verticils of three branches which join with the inner surface of the test; median bar in the plane of or slightly above the wide, circular mouth of the test; dorsal, primary lateral, and vertical bars cylindrical, long (85-110 µm), all but the last with a verticil of two branches which join with the inner surface of the test.  The dorsal and primary lateral bars pierce the shell wall terminally or subterminally and extend outward but downward as heavy, three-bladed feet.  The vertical bar extends as a heavy, three-bladed, ventrally ascending, vertical horn.  The apical bar extends as a similar, three-bladed apical horn, the blades of which are extended laterally as three irregular keels, each joining with one of the basal feet and pierced with numerous, unequal, irregular pores.

	Measurements; based on 4 specimens from stations 27, 56, and 106: maximum length of test (one specimen) 332 µm, maximum breadth 234-277 µm; length of apical horn 86 µm, of vertical horn 43 µm; of feet 25-49 µm.

	Remarks.  This species is similar to Haeckel'a illustration (1887, Pl. 57, fig. 8) of Clathromitra pterophormis Haeckel but differs from it in the presence of the double, spongy shell wall.  Haeckel's species is much smaller, but because this species is rare in the Gulf, its complete range of variation was not determined.
	Due to the large size of this species, specimens in permanent slides generally are oriented with their mouths downward; therefore, only apical views of this species are available.  One specimen from station 106 was studied in a wet slide.  The description given above is based for the most part on this single test, but it was impossible to photograph it.  Haeckel 's illustration of the right lateral side is very similar to this specimen and may be referred to in conjunction with the above description.

	Distribution.  This species is very rare in the Gulf.  It was observed only at stations 27, 34, 46, 56, 60, and 106.  It is, therefore, an oceanic species without great affinity for the waters of the Gulf.  Its only other known occurrence is from Challenger station 265 in the central Pacific (Haeckel, 1887, p. 1219).

Coracalyptra cervus (Ehrenberg)

Coracalyptra cervus (Ehrenberg), Popofsky, 1913, Deutsche Südpolar-Exped., vol. 14, pp. 383-384, Pl. 34, Fig. 3.

Test smooth, similar to Theopilium tricostatum Haeckel in the presence of a cephalis, thorax, and abdominal brim.  Shape of cephalis less regular than in T. tricostatum but with similar structure including a dorsal sagittal constriction and four collar pores at its base and a pair of external jugular pores at the top of the thorax.  Apical horn three-bladed to conical, heavy, in many specimens forked distally; vertical horn heavy, three-bladed to conical; in many tests a pair of divergent, laterally ascending, thin, conical spines originates from the upper surface of the cephalis.  Thorax separated from cephalis by a slight stricture; campanulate; with pores similar to those of T. tricostatum but less regular--hexagonally arranged but in a more variable number of transverse rows (6-14), generally hexagonal in shape, smaller proximally, increasing in size distally.  Abdominal brim generally more convex outwards (more nearly truncate-conical), less flat than in T. tricostatum (in one specimen with a rectangular outline), with pores similar to those of the thorax--hexagonally arranged in 1-5 or more transverse rows; brim separated from thorax by a distinct angular change in contour and an inner septal ring.  Dorsal and primary lateral bars either extend as free spines from the collar ring or as short thoracic ribs terminating in thin, conical spines; thoracic ribs do not extend as far in the thoracic wall as do those of T. tricostatum; secondary lateral bars present as ribs occupying the dorsal part of the collar stricture and in most tests extend laterally as thin, conical spines.

	Measurements; based on 23 specimens from stations 27, 34, 91, 133, 336, and 191: length of test 80-185 µm, of cephalis 17-23 µm, of thorax 55-118 µm, of apical horn 2-64 µm, of vertical horn 11-37 µm, of lateral cephalic spines 10-64 µm, of dorsal and primary lateral spines 4-25 µm, of secondary lateral spines 4-18 µm; breadth of cephalis 20-28 µm, of thorax 81-156 µm, of abdominal brim 118-244 µm.

	Remarks.  The differences between this species and Theopilium tricostatum Haeckel were discussed in the remarks of the latter.  I agree with Popofsky's synonymy (1913, pp. 383-384) and his reasons for it, namely, the presence in all of more than two horns with at least one (apical) forked distally and the observation that Haeckel's illustration of Sethoconus rayianus Haeckel shows an incomplete specimen lacking an abdomen.
	
	Distribution.  This species is cosmopolitan in the Gulf, being absent only at stations 90, 130, 192, 194, and all those to the north.  It is common at stations 91 (2.2%), 93 (2.0%), and 115 (3.6%) where it is the fifth most abundant species, nearly common at stations 106 and 133, and rare at all others.  Its increase at stations 91 and 93 is the result of its response to upwelling off the Baja California coast.  Its slightly greater frequency in the northern half of the Gulf may be due to its response to upwelling.  Its absence or near absence at marginal and northern shelf stations indicates its preference for more nearly oceanic offshore waters
	This species was reported from the western tropical part of the Indian Ocean (Haeckel, 1887, p. 1292; Ebrenberg, 1872a, p. 308; Popofsky, 1913, p. 385), the southern tropical Atlantic (Popofsky op. cit.) and the surface of the central Pacific at Challenger stations 266-272 (Haeckel, op. cit.).  It is, therefore, widespread in Recent tropical seas.

Stichopilium davisianum (Ehrenberg), Haeckel, 1887, Challenger Rept., Zool., vol. 18, pp. 1437-1438.
Theocalyptra davisiana (Ehrenberg), Riedel, 1958, B.A.N.Z.A.R.E. Repts., ser. B, vol. 6, pt. 10, p. 239, Pl. 4, figs. 2, 3, text-fig. 10.

	Remarks.  The writer agrees with Riedel's (1958, p. 239) reasons for assignment of this species to the genus Theocalyptra.  Specimens from the Gulf do not differ from Riedel's description of the species.  A few tests resemble Theocalyptra bicornis (Popofsky) Riedel (op. cit,. p. 240, Pl. 4, fig. 4) in shell outline but are assigned to T. davisiana.
	The presence of an internal septal ring dividing the abdomen from the thorax was observed only rarely in Gulf specimens.  The third joint or abdomen is not well-developed in most specimens.  The characteristic features of this species are the relatively smooth cephalis separated by only a slight stricture from a slender conical thorax which flares widely and abruptly changes contour distally to form a distinct shoulder in most tests and a less widely flaring joint (?) below the shoulder and of variable degree of development, being long in only a few specimens.  The thoracic pores are arranged in transverse rows, increase in size distally, and are generally subcircular to subpolygonal.  The apical and vertical spines are generally present but are thin and conical, rarely three-bladed; the primary lateral and dorsal spines generally originate at or near the collar stricture, but in a few specimens are very short thoracic ribs; the spines in a few tests are joined by lattice to the thoracic wall, presenting the appearance of low wings;  no secondary lateral bars or spines were observed; four collar pores are present.
	Except for the absence of a pronounced angular change of contour on the thorax, forms illustrated by Bailey (1856, Pl. 1, figs. 13, 14) and assigned to Halicalyptra? cornuta Bailey are similar to the Gulf forms.  Bailey's type material was not examined; therefore, placement of his species in synonymy with the Gulf species must await further study.

	Measurements; based on 30 specimens from stations 27 and 34: maximum length of test 63-107 µm; length of cephalis 15-21 µm, of thorax (including "joint" below shoulder) 37-73 µm; breadth of cephalis 16-25 µm; maximum breadth of test (joint below shoulder) 62-102 µm, of thorax 62-102 µm; length of apical spine 1-18 µm, of vertical, spine 0-16 mm, of dorsal and primary lateral spines 2-10 µm. 

	Distribution.  This species is cosmopolitan in the Gulf but has a much greater frequency in the southern half of the Gulf.  It is absent at stations 64, 71, 90, 130, 184, 191, and all those north of 194.  Its frequency is greater at stations located within the axial portion of the Gulf.  This together with its general absence at marginal stations indicates its preference for more nearly oceanic, offshore waters. It is common at most of the stations in the southern Gulf, namely, at stations 27 (4.6%) where it is the fourth most abundant species, 34 (2.2%), 46 (2.6%), 56 (2.2%), 60 (2.8%) where it is the sixth most abundant species, and 81 (2.8%).  It is nearly common at stations 95, 115, and 136.  Its decrease northward in the Gulf indicates its greater affinity for oceanic waters than for Gulf waters.  It apparently does not respond to upwelling.
	Riedel (1958, p. 239) states that this species occurs in the American and Indian Ocean sectors of Antarctic waters and in the tropical parts of the Pacific and Indian Oceans.  Ehrenberg (1862, pp. 297, 301) first reported this species from the northern Atlantic.  Riedel (op.cit.) states that this species may be cosmopolitan, and it appears to be more common in sediments from high and middle latitudes than in those from tropical regions.

	Long, slender, conical test with 7-10 or more annulated joints, the last joint (eight) in one specimen bulbous, with its mouth closed by a lattice with large, irregular, polygonal pores larger than those of its proximal portion and the joints above it; all other specimens apparently incompletely developed, without basal mouth closed.  Joints of the test separated by annular strictures occupied by internal septal rings.  Cephalis subspherical, nearly hyaline but with small (1-2 µm) pores separated by wide, heavy intervening bars; at its base four collar pores.  A slender, conical apical horn extends from the apical bar which is a dorsal rib in the cephalic wall; in tests with apical horn completely developed the horn is very long and curves ventrally, its distal portion nearly perpendicular to the axis of the test.  The dorsal and primary lateral bars extend a short distance as ribs in the thoracic wall and terminate in short, thin, inconspicuous spines; in a few specimens (including the one with its basal mouth closed) there are a few, thin, conical spines originating from the joints below the cephalis and arranged in three longitudina1 rows, apparently representing rudimentary supporting structures of raised, dorsal and primary lateral longitudinal ribs as in Cyrtopera laguncula Haeckel; in one specimen studied in a wet slide there are six, raised, equally spaced, longitudinal ribs joined to the test by a lattice (thus wing-like) and without constrictions in their outline at the level of each constriction in the test.  The proximal four to five joints below the cephalis are of nearly equal length and increase only gradually in breadth, with 2-4 transverse rows of hexagonally arranged, equal, hexagonal pores per joint.  The distal joints slightly longer than the proxima1 ones, of nearly equal length, but breadth of successive joints increases more abruptly and joints less cylindrical and more nearly campanulate; therefore, much broader distally; distal joints with pores slightly larger but similar to those of the proximal joints, with 5-8 transverse rows per joint.

	Measurements; based on 3 specimens from stations 93, 60, and 115: maximum length of test 144-185 µm (of test with basal mouth closed 171 µm), of cephalis 16-17 µm; maximum breadth of test (last joint) 68-71 µm, of cephalis 18-22 µm; length of apical horn (one specimen) 221 µm.

	Remarks.  Riedel (1958, p. 244) states that the rare occurrence of specimens he identified as Cyrtocapsa sp. from Antarctic waters made establishment of their range of variation impossible.  Specimens from the Gulf are even more rare, but one specimen mentioned above with its terminal mouth closed and the few with surface spines arranged in three longitudinal rows are identical with Haeckel's illustration of Cyrtopora laguncula Haeckel (1887, Pl. 75, fig. 10).  The other species listed as being tentatively synonymous with this species may represent incompletely developed forms of C. 1aguncula.  Riedel 
(1958, p. 244) states that these forms may be identical, but until this species can be more closely defined it will not be known whether or not it represents one species or a group of species.

	Distribution.  This species or species-group is very rare in the Gulf.  It is present at only 5 stations in the Gulf, namely 46, 56, 60, and 93 in the southern Gulf and 115 in the northern Gulf.  It is, therefore, a rare member of the oceanic assemblage with little affinity for Gulf waters.
	Riedel (1958, p. 244) states that specimens of his Antarctic species or closely related species, including some of those mentioned in the tentative synonymy, are widely distributed in sediments of the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans and of the northern Pacific.  Haeckel (1887, p. 1451) reported Cyrtopera laguncula Haeckel from the southern Pacific at "Challenger" station 298 located in the Humboldt Current off the Chilean coast.  Eucyrtidium cornutella Ehrenberg (1862, p. 298) was reported from the North Atlantic near Greenland.  Whether all these forms represent a single species or a group of species, they apparently are cosmopolitan.

Dictycoryne cf. truncatum (Ehrenberg)

?Rhopalodictyum truncatum Ehrenberg, 1861, Akad. Berlin Monatsb. (1861), p. 301; Haeckel, 1887, Challenger Rept., Zool., vol. 18, pp. 589-590.

	Test with three, broad, spongy arms, equally to bilaterally disposed, generally with, but in several specimens without, a spongy patagium between.  Central region not spongy, consisting of 5-10 or more concentric latticed discoidal shells; arms narrow proximally for a short distance, becoming broad and thick, elliptical in section, distally.  In specimens without a patagium the arms have a definite margin; in those with a patagium margin of arms indefinite, appears to merge with the spongy patagium; in several specimens arms observed only as triangular dark areas.

	Measurements; based on 30 specimens from stations 46, 56, 60, 71, and 81: angle A 112°-139°, mean 126°; angle B 92°-116°, mean 108°; angle C 114°-144°, mean 127°; ratio of angle A to B 1.03-1.43, mean 1.17, of angle C to B 1.07-1.43, mean 1.18; diameter of outermost concentric shell of central region (11 specimens with number of shells ranging from 5-10) 68-117 µm; maximum breadth of arms 86-153 µm; length of base of triangular test 172-343 µm, of altitude 177-348 µm.

	Remarks.  Specimens lacking a patagium and having arms with a definite margin closely resemble Ehrenberg's illustration of Dictyastrum angulatum Ehrenberg (1872b, P1. 8, fig. 18) in symmetry, size, and shape of the arms.  Haeckel (1887, p. 524) in his discussion of this species also states that this figure seems to represent a Spongodiscid (spongy arms), but in the same locality (Philippine Sea) he observed a true Dictyastrum of quite the same form, with concentric rings in the arms and three to four concentric rings (shells?) of the central disc.  The internal structure of the arms of the Gulf specimens appears to be spongy and does not consist of distinct, internal, concentric rings.  Specimens lacking the patagium correspond to the genus Rhopalodictyum Ehrenberg.  Haeckel (1887, pp. 589-590) states that Rhopalodictyum truncatum Ehrenberg is probably identical with Ehrenberg's figure of Dictyastrum angulatum and differs from it apparently in the presence of spongy arms.  Haeckel placed the latter species in tentative synonymy with the former.  The majority of specimens of this species from the Gulf have a patagium; therefore, this species was placed in the genus Dictyocoryne Ehrenberg.  Because according to Haeckel, Rhopalodictyum truncatum Ehrenberg is similar to Dictyastrum angulatum Ehrenberg but has spongy arms, and because specimens from the Gulf with spongy arms but lacking the patagium are similar in appearance to the illustration of the latter, the Gulf species is tentatively identified with the former, which, however, was not illustrated by Ehrenberg.
	Popofsky (1912, p. 137, text fig. 52) illustrated a form which he tentatively identified as Euchitonia mülleri Haeckel.  This form, however, is identical with D. cf. truncatum . It appears to be spongy and has an incompletely developed patagium.

	Distribution.  This species is cosmopolitan in the Gulf but is rare at all stations where it is present.  It is absent at stations 90, 203, and 214.  Its highest frequency (l.7%) was observed at station 194 in the northern Gulf, indicating some tolerance for waters of higher than average salinity and temperature.  Its frequency in the southern half of the Gulf, however, is slightly greater than in the northern half.  It does not appear to be controlled by upwelling.
	Rhopalodictyum truncatum Ehrenberg was reported from the Philippine Sea by Ehrenberg and Haeckel and from the tropical Pacific by Haeckel.  The form illustrated by Popofsky (1912, text fig. 52) which is similar to the Gulf species was reported from near the Cape of Good Hope.  Due to the uncertain taxonomic status of this species little can be stated about its world-wide distribution.  It appears to be confined to tropical or subtropical seas.

<de_description><![CDATA[Dictyophimus histricosus:
Cephalis semispherical, thorax pyramidal.

The basal spines extend from the central rod (under the neck stricture) to the thorax and continue in the thoracic wall to the very margin below where they protrude as basal feet". The apical spine, D, runs chiefly in the wall of the cephalis (as in the two preceding species) and above is prolongated to a tophorn, which is only very little different to the byspines in appearance. This is also the case with the ventral, sagittal spine, which runs obliquely upwards and out through the neck stricture.

All the main spines are narrow, not three edged.

Cephalis and thorax rather plentifully provided with narrow, needle shaped byspines, which are longest and most numerous on the cephalis. The longest are as long, or even a little longer, than the diameter of the cephalis.

The pores are uneven in shape and size, varying from quite small to 9 µm, not much smaller on the cephalis than on the thorax. Here too the three swellings on the upper part of the thorax between the main spines (fig. 89 b) are to be found.

The width of the lattice shell is 85 µ, its height (not including the basal feet) 68 µm. The cephalis alone is 34 µm wide and 22 µm high.

Very rare and only singly: 19/1 1899, 40 miles NW of Gaukværø, 0 700 m.; Henningsvær, 21/2 1899, 0 250 m.

<de_description><![CDATA[Benson, 1966, p. 180-182; pl. 7, figs. 7-11:

Druppatractus irregularis Popofsky

Druppotractus [sic.]  irregularis Popofsky, 1912, Deutsche Tiefsee-Exped , vol 13, pp 114-115, text figs 24-26.

	An inner pear-shaped shell and outer ellipsoidal shell as in Druppatractus cf. pyriformis but with fewer and thinner three-bladed, radial beams joining them (10-15).  Two heavier polar beams generally coaxial with the major shell axis and each continuous with a polar spine; polar spines of unequal length but in contrast to Druppatractus cf. pyriformis the greater polar spine continuous with beam arising from pole opposite the one with the small lobe of the pear-shaped inner shell; lesser polar spine absent in many specimens; lesser polar spine, its associated beam, and the major axis of the inner shell (including the small lobe) displaced in many specimens as much as 30-40° from the major axis and coaxial greater polar spine of the outer shell; accessory spines continuous outward from the thinner radial beams generally absent, but 1-5 short, three-bladed spines present in a few specimens and generally located around one or the other pole of the major axis.  Outer shell thin-walled, relatively smooth but generally with short thorns at the nodes of the intervening bars, with small, subequal, subregularly arranged polygonal to subpolygonal or subcircular pores, 12-18 (generally 15) on half the minor circumference, without polygonal frames.  Inner shell with thin wall, smooth surface, with subequal, hexagonally arranged polygonal pores, 7-8 on half the minor circumference.

	Measurements; based on 30 specimens from stations 27, 34, and 71: major diameter of outer shell 69-92 µm, of inner shell 38-46 µm; minor diameter of outer shell 59-84 µm, of inner shell 30-34 µm; length of greater polar spine 4-33 µm, of lesser polar spine (when present) 6-22 µm, of accessory radial spines 2-21 µm.

	Remarks.  The cortical shell of this species is much less variable in size and thickness of its wall than in Druppatractus cf. pyriformis.  The presence of the pear-shaped medullary shell is a unique and constant feature in both species and was not observed in any other species from the Gulf.

	Distribution.  This species is less abundant in the Gulf than D. cf. pyriformis.  It is common to rare as far north as station 130 but is rare or absent farther north.  It is absent at stations 133, 191, 203, 208, and 214.  Its highest frequency was observed at stations 71 (4.4%) and 95 (4.0%) where at each it is the fifth most abundant species.  It does not increase significantly in areas of upwelling; in fact, at station 90, it is very rare in contrast to the high frequency of the preceding species, but at station 91 it is almost common.  Its greater frequency in the southern half of the Gulf and its decrease toward the north indicates its greater affinity for the tropical Pacific water masses than for those of higher temperature and salinity.  Its distribution may also be controlled, in part, by upwelling, but the available data are too meager to make any conclusions regarding this.
	Popofsky (1912, p. 115) reported this species from the western tropical part of the Indian Ocean and from the tropical part of the central Atlantic Ocean.  It, therefore, appears to be confined to the tropical parts of the world's oceans, unless the pear-shaped shell illustrated by Bailey (1856, Pl. 1, fig. 29) and reported from a high latitude is identical with this species, not with Druppatractus cf. pyriformis.

<de_description><![CDATA[Drymyomma elegans:
Aeussere Kugel dickwandig, mit ziemlich grossen, breitwandigen Poren, Durchmesser 0,096 mm. 

Mittlere Kugel mit viel kleineren, breitwandigen Poren. Durchmesser 0,036 mm. 

Innerste Kugel ungefähr wie die zweite, nur kleiner: Durchmesser 0,015 mm. 

Ungefähr 20 kräftige, dreischneidige, lang zugespitzte, im Basaltheile breite Hauptstacheln, die etwas ungleich lang sind, bis 0,084 mm. hervorragend. Diese Hauptstacheln sind zwischen den zwei äusseren Kugeln schmäler, erreichen ihre grösste Breite erst an der Aussenseite der dritten Kugel. Die kleinsten Radialstacheln sind häufig mit einem einfachen Ast versehen. 

Ausserdem finden sich an der äusseren Kugel zahlreiche cylindrischen Nebenstacheln, etwas mehr als halb so lang wie die Hauptstacheln, an der Mitte oder höher in 2 bis 4 divergirende Aeste getheilt. 

Diese schöne neue Art ist bei uns selten: Mai, August-Novbr., immer sehr spärlich.
 
Ich habe nur wenige Male die ganz entwickelte Form mit den characteristischen verzweigten Nebenstacheln gefunden. Häufig kommt eine andere vor, die sehr an Echinomma trinacrium erinnert, jedoch viel schlankere Haupt- unt Nebenstacheln besitzt. Die letzteren sind an solchen Exemplaren viel weniger entwickelt, ausserdem noch unverästelt. 

Diese Formen lassen sich meiner Erfahrung nach ungezwungen als eine Jugendform der obigen Art erklären. ]]></de_description>

Eucyrtidium anomalum Haeckel

Lithocampe anomala Haeckel, 1861b, Akad. Berlin, Monatsb. (1860), p.839.
Eucyrtidium anomalum Haeckel, 1862, Die Radiolarien, pp. 323-324, Pl. 7, figs. 11-13.

	Cephalis spherical, with rough surface and very small circular pores, in many specimens infilled with silica; cephalis slightly depressed within the thorax and separated from this joint by a distinct change in contour and generally by an indistinct constriction.  Thorax long, broad distally, truncate-conical to slightly campanulate, with smooth surface and small, equal, hexagonal to subcircular pores, hexagonally arranged in longitudinal rows which are generally continuous with similar rows on the abdominal joints.  Abdominal joints smooth, about one-half to one-third the length of the thorax, approximately of equal length, generally three in number, with pores the same as those of the thorax; joints separated from one another by regular, continuous, circular, internal septal rings but not by distinct annular constrictions; distal septal ring or rings irregular, discontinuous in a few specimens.  First abdominal joint separated from thorax by a septal ring but generally not by a distinct annular stricture.  Broadest joint of the test generally the first abdominal joint; distal joints with sides tapering inward slightly, the last joint nearly cylindrical but with its distal portion curved inward; no hyaline peristorne, terminal or subterminal spines, or latticed tubular mouth observed.  Apical bar an internal columella in the dorsal portion of the cephalic cavity, prolonged as a straight, vertical, three-bladed, eccentric apical spine or horn.  Vertical spine short, thin, inconspicuous. Collar ring distinct, heavy, circular, with four small, circular collar pores separated by heavy vertical, median and primary lateral bars.  Thoracic ribs corresponding to the dorsal and primary lateral bars terminate in the wall of the thorax above its base; they vary from indistinct ribs coincident with slight furrows in the thoracic wall to raised ribs coincident with angular shoulder-like swellings of the thoracic wall that resemble latticed wings; in other tests the ribs are raised only slightly above the thoracic surface and are more like the wing-like ribs of Eusyringium siphonostoma.

	Measurements; based on 10 specimens from stations 27, 34, and 46: maximum length of test 129-160 µm, maximum breadth 81-96 µm; length of cephalis 18-25 µm, of thorax 53-65 µm, of abdominal joints 22-39 µm; breadth of cephalis 22-25 µm, of thorax 77-92 µm; length of apical spine or horn 2-27 µm, of vertical spine 2-5 µm.

	Remarks.  This species differs from incompletely developed specimens of Eusyringium siphonostoma in its greater breadth relative to length, the presence of a longer thorax and generally only three abdominal joints, in the pronounced shoulder-like thoracic swellings in many tests, and in a nearly hyaline cephalis with a distinct separation from the thorax.  This species agrees in all details with Eucyrtidium anomalum Haeckel from the Mediterranean Sea.

	Distribution.  This species is very rare but nearly cosmopolitan in the Gulf.  It is present as far north as station 184 but is absent north of this station as well as at stations 90, 91, 95, and 130.  Its low relative frequency is about the same throughout the Gulf; therefore, analysis of its control by upwelling cannot be determined.  Its presence in the northern Gulf indicates some degree of tolerance for waters of higher than average temperature and salinity, but its absence at most of the marginal stations and all of the northernmost shelf localities indicates its preference for offshore, more nearly oceanic waters.  It is apparently a tropical species.  Its only other known occurrence is in the Mediterranean Sea.

<de_description><![CDATA[Euscenium corynephorum:
Has the four primary spines, about equally developed, and the ventral, sagittal one.

The main spines are broad, three-edged, broadest in the outer half. On each edge there are from 3 to 5, or more, strong slender pointed branches (spines), more or less distinctly scattered in comparison to those on the other edges of the same spine, only rarely here and there in distinct verticils.

Between the neighbouring branches or the different main spines, rather long and fine connecting beams extend, these being in their turn again connected by numerous similar ones. Thus a more or less perfect net is formed which is best developed between the apical spine (D) and the ventral, sagittal one. This network forms a rather imperfect lattice shell with meshes, very uneven in shape and size, from small, triangular and trapezoidal to very large, polygonal openings. Also the inner branches (spines) on the same main spine are connected, partly with the main spine itself, partly with each other, also by fine connecting beams, parallel to the direction of the main spine (as in the spines of Rhizoplegma boreale).

The meshes of the lattice shell strongly recall those of Cladoscenium tricolpium. Very often (in young individuals) so little of the network is developed that it would not be justifiable to consider the species as a Euscenium, if one did not occasionally find a well developed latice shell. Cfr. Jørgensen 1900.

This species is very different from Cladoscenium tricolpium, and without doubt is more closely allied to those forms which have an imperfect lattice shell (Plectoidea HCK.). It might be classed as belonging to the genus Periplecta HCK., if it were not for the distinct, ventral, sagittal spine.	(This spine was previously overlooked, and for this reason is not mentioned in my earlier description of the species [Jørgensen 1900] p. 77). I prefer at present to let it remain in the genus Euscenium, rather than to start a new genus, as the genus Euscenium HCK. certainly requires revision.]]></de_description>

<de_description><![CDATA[Gonosphaera (p. 132):
The very peculiar, little species which belongs here, seems to be constructed in the flowing way: There are two rather regular pentagons, having one side in common. Their planes form an angle of about 120°. At the four corners there are long spines, pointing obliquely outwards in different directions. Between the fifth corners, one in each pentagon, opposite to their common side, there is a three-jointed connecting arch, bent outwards from both the pentagons. This arch carries in the two corners which do not lie in the original pentagons (but farthest away from them), two long, diverging spines.

Gonosphaera primordialis: (p. 132-133)
I will add a few remarks to the description already given of the genus. In most positions, this species will have the appearance of a more or less distinct pentagon, with long spines at the corners, and also a connecting arch with three similar spines. Looking straight towards one of the two pentagons (with a side in common), the connecting arch with its spines, will look like two long spines, connected by a short cross beam.

I cannot say where this species really belongs, but judging from the skeleton and the position of the central capsule, it would seem to belong to the Nassellaria. I have, however, only once seen the plasmatic parts. The species does not seem to be so very rare, but is easily overlooked on account of its small size.

Found in rather many samples from deep water, always in small numbers.

Distribution: Also on the west coast of Norway. Probably boreal oceanic.

Heliosphaera radiata Popofsky

Heliosphaera radiata Popofsky, 1912, Deutsche Südpolar-Exped., vol. 13, p. 98, text fig. 10.

	Single lattice-shell, spherical to subspherical, with 5-30 (generally 8-12) radial, three-bladed, in a few tests conical, equal to subequal main spines arising from its surface, without definite arrangement.  Pores of shell generally polygonal (hexagonal), subequal in size, but ranging from subelliptical to irregular and unequal, generally with subregular to regular (hexagonal) arrangement, with or without polygonal frames, 10-24 (generally 12-15) on the half circumference.  Thin, conical, equal by-spines arise from the nodes of the generally thin intervening bars as well as from along the bars, variable in number from very few to present at all nodes, with variable length (5-30 µm).  In most specimens the main spines continue within the shell cavity as thin, conical, centripetal spines, generally short, in a few tests relatively long.  No specimens were observed with an inner shell.

	Measurement; based on 30 specimens from stations 27, 34, and 71: diameter of shell 101-212 µm (generally 110-154 µm); length of main spines 10-50 µm.

	Remarks.  This species does not differ from Popofsky's description and illustration of the single specimen he used in defining Heliosphaera radiata Popofsky (1912, p. 98).  Study of numerous individuals from the Gulf revealed that the number and length of main spines is variable and that in numerous specimens the pores are not hexagonal but tend to be elliptical or irregular.  Popofsky did not observe the presence of centripetal spines which are inward continuations of the three-bladed main spines, but this feature is not present in all specimens from the Gulf and when present is not easily observed.

	Distribution.  In the Gulf this species is rare at all stations except 184 and 194 where it is common.  It is absent at stations 130, 203, and 214.  Its increased frequency at stations 184 and 194 is parallel to that of Hexacontium entacanthum Jørgensen and Diploplegma banzare Riedel.  Because these stations are in the northern Gulf whose waters are subject to greater ranges of salinity and temperature than in normal oceanic regions at comparable latitudes, Heliosphaera radiata Popofsky as well as the species mentioned above apparently have a greater tolerance for such changes.  Elsewhere in the Gulf H. radiata does not undergo any significant increase in its frequency at marginal stations located in regions of upwelling.
	Popofsky (1912, p. 98) reported H. radiata from the tropical part of the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar at a depth of 400 meters.  It has not been reported from high latitudes; therefore, it is probably a tropical oceanic species.]]></de_description>

<de_description><![CDATA[Hexacontium enthacanthum (p. 115):
I will only add a few remarks to the detailed description given in 1.c. (Jørgensen 1900, p. 52). This species differs from the following [Hexacontium pachydermum] in having a delicate outer shell with comparatively narrow walls between the pores and no byspines. 

As in the following species [H. pachydermum], the pores on the outer shell are different in size, from 6-10µ, most of them being 8µ, although they are not strikingly unlike. 

The pores of the middle shell in both species are also alike, there is a slightly variation in the size of them on the same shell, they average 4-5µ (seldom as little as 3 or as much as 7). The pores on the two outer shells area bout equal in number on the radius. But the innermost shell differs considerably in this respect, the pores here being comparatively much larger and consequently much fewer in number. 

On young specimens, where only the two inner shells are developed, one may often see transverse processus on the radial spines where the outer shell is found later on, these processus forming the intermediate walls of those pores in the outer shell which are situated nearest to the main spines. On still younger specimens, however, these processus are also wanting. 

Such forms (cfr. Jørgensen 1905, pl. 8, fig. 32) may easily be mistaken for species of genus Hexalonche. If one considers the coincidence in dimensions and constructions of the inner shells of Hexacontium enthacanthum and H. pachydermum, it would, however, seem most reasonable to look upon them as being forms of these species. 

The outer shell varies in its development from very thin to moderately thick. The pores on the thicker shells seem to be rounder and to have wider walls, which are more plainly widened out in the corners. 

I have very rarely seen specimens with a trace of byspines (conically heightened parts) in the corners between the pores. These traces of byspines appear, however, to denote that the limit in the direction of H. pachydermum is not certain. The common name ought in this case to be H. pachydermum, which would then represent the grown form. 

The number of the main spines is usually 6, and sometimes 7, but very seldom more. These are usually about equal in breadth inside as well as outside the outer ball. 

Ocean forms, of which I have seen few, seem to diverge somewhat (both in this and the following species). The specimen illustrated pl. 8, fig. 30 [Jørgensen 1905] for instance, had a rather strong outer shell with main spines, which, as is the case with H. pachydermum, where considerably narrower inside the shell than outside. The inmost shell too was more solid than usual, and had comparatively more pores with stronger walls (cfr. fig. 30b). 

The dimensions of the outer and middle shells on 7 individuals (the 6 from the west coast of Norway): Thus it will be seen that the diameter of the middle shell varies remarkably little, while that of the outer varies considerably. 

Rare, in deep water samples, always in small numbers.

Distribution: 
Temperate oceanic form, which with us is only found in deep water, especially at a depth of 300m or more. Somewhat more frequent on the west coast of Norway. Also known from scattered spots in the sea beyond the coast of Norway and from the Faeroe and Shetland Isles northwards. ]]></de_description>

<de_description><![CDATA[Hexacontium pachydermum:
The byspines on the outer shell vary considerably in length. They are found in all corners where the pores meet, so that each pore is surrounded by several byspines (generally 5 or 6). The pores on the outer shell are more or less round, the intermediate walls being on the whole broader than in the preceding species (Hexacontium enthacanthum), answering to the development of the outer shell which is altogether stronger in this species. This shell is especially thick. The length of the main spines varies considerably. The byspines on the middle shell are little conspicuous, and may be easy overlooked (as in the case of the preceding species, H. enthacanthum). The innermost shell is here seen less clearly than in H. enthacanthum, unless the thicker outer shell be removed. One may, therefore, easily mistake this species for a Hexalonche, by overlooking the inside ball. I have, however, repeatedly convinced myself on breaking the outer shells, that it is always present. Its construction is the same as in the preceding species.

No important difference in dimensions between this species and the preceding one seems to be found, and this is a very important factor when considering the question as to whether these supposed species are specifically different, or only constitute different forms of one of the same species. Here too the outer shell varies in size, but the middle and inmost ones are remarkably uniform in this respect and resemble those of H. enthacanthum. The ocean forms, however, appear to diverge essentially. I have not had an opportunity, though, of studying them more thoroughly in richer material, so that I cannot yet give a definite opinion as to the probability of separating new species. This, however, does not seem unlikely. For such a strong developed ocean form from the sea beyond Söndmöre (in February 1901, S/S Michael Sars, a sample kindly given to me by Dr. Gran) was found. 

Strong, long main spines (most of the broken off). Numerous byspines (4-6 round each pore), long, needle shaped, 40µ  long (nearly 4/5 of the radius of the outer shell). Outer shell very thickwalled (6-7µ thick), pores almost even, +/-8µ, very broadwalled, round, a little broader than the walls. 7 main spines, much narrower between the outer shells than outside the outmost one. The diameter of the three balls 108, 39, 19µ.

Occurred like the preceding species rather rarely and sparsely in deep water samples, though perhaps somewhat more frequently. As a rule it is found in deep water samples from such outer places where the sea water has easy access. During the spring diatom inflow, it seem generally toe be absent, except at greater depths in the inner fiords, where scattered specimens occur. This also seems to be the care, on the whole, with regard to the other Spumellaria. 

Distribution: 
Chiefly the same as in the preceding species [Hexacontium enthacanthum], often found together with it. 

[Temperate oceanic form, which with us is only found in deep water, especially at a depth of 300m or more. Somewhat more frequent on the west coast of Norway. Also known from scattered spots in the sea beyond the coast of Norway and from the Faeroe and Shetland Isles northwards.]

Hexapyle dodecantha Haeckel
 
Hexapyle dodecantha Haeckel, 1887, Challenger Rept., Zool., vol. 18, p. 569, Pl. 48, fig. 16. 
Py1odiscus triangularis Haeckel, 1887, Challenger Rept., Zool., vol. 18, p. 570, Pl. 48, fig. 17. 
 
	Test consisting of a double pylodiscid shell; with outer shell larger than that of Discopyle ? sp. but with similar arrangement of twelve radial spines and, in several specimens, with one, two, or three radial beams each extending across the tubular spaces through the shell; with or without a large but irregularly-pored lattice covering the surfaces of the outer shell (text-fig. 20).  Latticed covering, when present, with numerous (50 or more) radial spines arising from its surface and branching at a common level; in a few specimens, the branches of these spines anastomose to form part of an outer triangular or ellipsoidal latticed shell which was never observed fully developed; completely developed tests, therefore, not discoidal.  Innermost structure within first pylodiscid shell not observed but may consist of a central node from which radiate the three radial beams mentioned above.

	Measurements; based on 9 specimens from stations 27, 71, 81, and 92: length of base of inner triangular pylodiscid shell 18-43 µm, of outer pylodiscid shell 80-137 µm,  of altitude of inner shell 20-42 µm, of outer shell 74-128 µm; length of base of outer triangular shell covering double pylodiscid shell 113-185 µm, of altitude 122-154 µm.

	Remarks.  This species differs from Discopyle ? sp. in the larger outer pylodiscid shell and the lack of a spongy network developed beyond this shell and the outer shell; the outer shell of this species is not a relatively smooth ellipsoid as in the preceding species but a somewhat irregular, generally subtriangular shell.  Specimens conforming.to Haeckel's illustrations of Hexapyle dodecantha and Pylodiscus triangularis as well as several which show intergradations from the former (without latticed cover) to the latter (with latticed cover) were observed.  Because Hexapyle is the earlier described genus and H. dodecantha has page priority over P. triangularis, the former was chosen as the nominal species.  The two species of Discopyle that were 
illustrated by Haeckel (1887, Pl. 48, figs. 19-20) may be similar to if not the same as Hexapyle dodecantha instead of Discopyle ? sp., but this could not be investigated because of the difficulty in observation of the inner triangular shells and the lack of access to Haeckel's type material.

	Distribution.  Identification of this species presents the same problem, i.e., one of orientation, as in Discopyle ? sp.   The frequency of this species in the Gulf, therefore, may be greater than actually indicated.  Numerous, relatively large ellipsoidal shells were counted as a group designated as Litheliacea unidentified (Pl. 1, no. 67) if some indication of inner latticed girdles were observed.  These specimens, therefore, may include representatives of Phorticium pyloniuxn, Discopyle? sp., Hexapyle dodecantha, and Larcopyle bütschlii.  This group is common to rare at all stations in the Gulf except 203 and 204 where it is absent.  It occurs in greater numbers in the southern Gulf; thus it is parallel to the distribution of the members comprising it.
	Specimens identifiable as Hexapyle dodecantha occur rarely in the Gulf but as far north as station 192.  None were observed at stations 64, 115, 130, 191, 194, and those to the north.  They occur with greater frequency in the southern Gulf and, therefore, may prefer oceanic water masses.
	Both Hexapyle dodecantha and Pylodiscus triangularis were reported by Haeckel from "Challenger" station 270 in the central Pacific.  Their apparent absence in high latitudes indicates that they may be confined to tropical regions.

Central region of test circular to subtriangular in outline, consisting of 4-5 concentric discoidal latticed shells, therefore, biconvex in side view.  Arms very narrow proximally, increasing only gradually in breadth for most of their length, terminating in broad bulbous tips, a few of which were observed with 3-4 internal concentric shells or rings.  Internal structure of arms consisting of numerous (13-25) concentric, irregular, partial rings, subequally spaced, more or less perpendicular to the outer latticed cover of the arm.  In most specimens the internal structure of the test is not distinct and the center as well as the arms appear spongy.  The arms and center covered with a generally distinguishable, small-pored latticed sheath.  Several specimens were observed with 1-3 terminal spines on one or more of the arms, 4-31 µm in length.

	Measurements; based on 30 specimens from stations 27, 34, 46, 56, 60, 64, 71, and 81: angle A 111°-142°, mean 126°; angle B 95°-l26°, mean 111°; angle C 111°-l33°, mean 123°; ratio of angle A to angle B 0.98-1.49, mean 1.13; ratio of angle C to angle B 0.88-1.29, mean 1.11; diameter of outer concentric shell of central region 55-84 µm; length of odd arm (if not distinguishable an arm was chosen at random) 96-209 µm, of each of the two similar arms 96-205 µm, and 101-197 µm, minimum breadth of odd arm 27-48 µm, of each of the two similar arms 27-47 µm and 26-48 µm; maximum breadth of bulbous tip of odd arm 50-112 µm of each of the two similar arms 48-123 µm and 49-114 µm; length of base of triangular test 218-411 µm, of altitude 203-369 µm.

Remarks.  This species is similar to Hymeniastrum koellikeri [=Dictyocoryne profunda] but differs from it in the presence of narrower arms with bulbous tips, a smaller central region with fewer concentric shells, the lack of a clearly distinguishable odd arm in most specimens, the presence of arms nearly equally disposed in most specimens, and in the presence of a patagium that is thicker distally than proximally.
	Although the shape of the arms of this species is similar to Haeckel's illustration (1887, P1. 143, fig. 13) of Hymeniastrum euclidis, the patagium is not; however, specimens from the Gulf may be incomplete.  Examination of Haeckel's type material of this species may establish its identity with the Gulf species.  Popofsky's illustration (1912, text fig. 51) of H. euclidis is of a form with an incomplete patagium.  His interpretation of the internal structure agrees with the writer's, and the shape of the arms is identical with that of the Gulf species; therefore, the Gulf species is identified as H. euclidis on the basis of comparison with Popofsky's, not Haeckel's, figure.

	Distribution. This species is cosmopolitan but rare in the Gulf.  It is absent at stations 136, 191, 194, 203, and 214.  It has a higher than average frequency in the southern Gulf with highest frequency (1.4%) at station 64 located in a region of upwelling.  It does not increase, however, at other stations located within areas of upwelling.  Its general decrease northward in the Gulf suggests its greater affinity for oceanic water masses.
	Popofsky (1912, p. 137) reported .this species from approximately 20° N. latitude in the central Atlantic.  Haeckel (1887, p. 531) reported H. euclidis from the surface of the equatorial Pacific at "Challenger" stations 270-274.  This species, therefore, appears to be a tropical species.  It has not been reported from high latitudes.

Lampromitra quadricuspis Haeckel

Lampromitra quadricuspis Haeckel, 1887, Challenger Rept., Zool., vol.18, pp. 1214-1215, Pl. 58, fig. 7.

	Smooth to thorny, elongate, ellipsoidal cephalis separated from a low, broad, conical, smooth thorax by an angular change in contour.  Pores of cephalis subequal, subcircular to subelliptical or subpolygonal, smaller than those of the proximal portion of the thorax.  A long, heavy, conical to three-bladed horn originates from the top of the cephalis and is apparently unrelated to the apical bar which is present as a short rib in the dorsal cephalic wall.  The apical spine extending from this rib is short, thin, conical and originates from the dorsal face of the cephalis.  The vertical spine is thin, conical, of variable length and either originates from the base of the cephalis or its proximal portion extends for a short distance as a rib in the proximal portion of the thorax; it generally is nearly horizontal or has a slight downward curvature.  The dorsal and primary lateral bars originate from a short median bar that is present within the proximal portion of the thoracic cavity.  The primary lateral bars join the thorax below the collar region and extend as distinct ribs in the thoracic wall that are prolonged into conical terminal spines, although in a few tests one or both of these spines originate from the thorax above its base; the dorsal bar joins the thoracic wall at a lower level and likewise extends as a distinct thoracic rib prolonged into a conical terminal spine; these spines are not different from the 10-22 (generally 18-20) long, conical terminal spines originating from the basal margin of the thorax.  Thorax with large subpolygonal to subcircular pores, increasing in size distally, arranged in approximate transverse rows (7-10), the pores of each row being of nearly the same size.  Basal margin of thorax with irregular, more or less zig-zag outline; terminal spines with a few small, distal branches.

	Measurernents; based on 11 specimens from stations 34, 46, 56, 60, 115, and 133: length of cephalis 34-43 µm, of thorax 43-187 µm; breadth of cephalis 31-36 µm, of thorax 129-351 µm; length of cephalic horn 18-62 µm, of vertical spine 9-32 µm, of dorsal and primary lateral spines 22-98 µm, of accessory terminal spines 12-37 µm.

	Remarks.  The only difference between this species and Lampromitra quadricuspis Haeckel is the presence in the latter of three divergent lateral branches of the cephalic horn that are directed upward and correspond in position to the thoracic ribs.  Because this species is rare in the Gulf and most of the tests have their cephalic horns broken, the constancy of this character within the species could not be determined.

	Distribution.  This species is cosmopolitan but generally rare in the Gulf, occurring as far north as station 208.  It is absent at stations 27, 64, 90, 95, 130, 194, 203, 206, and 214.  Its absence or very rare occurrence at most marginal localities indicates its preference for more nearly oceanic, offshore waters.  It has a slight1y higher average frequency in the northern half of the Gulf and is common (2.0%) at station 106 which is located within the diatomite facies; therefore, it may respond to upwelling in the northern Gulf.  It is nearly common at station 81 in the southern Gulf, a fact which may indicate a response to upwelling along either coast.
	Haeckel (1887, p. 1215) reported this species from the surface of the Atlantic near the Canary Islands; therefore, it is apparently widespread in Recent Tropical seas.

Larcopyle bütschlii Dreyer 

Larcopyle bütschlii Dreyer, 1889, Jenaische Zeitschr. Naturwiss., vol. 23, pp. 124-125, Pl. 10, fig. 70.

	Large ellipsoidal shell when fully developed with regular outline; surface with scattered short (5-25 µm) conical spines or thorns continuous inward as beams; pores unequal, irregular, larger than those of preceding species [Larcopyle? sp]; at one pole in a few specimens a cluster of short (5-12 µm) conical spines but without definite opening or pylome.  Internal structure consists of irregular but generally recognizable latticed lamellae joined by numerous radial beams, in several specimens with an identifiable pylonid structure of concentric trizonal shells or spirals, particularly apparent in those with outer shell not fully developed (Pl. 19, figs. 3-4).  Those specimens with a recognizable internal triangular pylodiscid shell were placed within Discopyle ? sp.

	Measurements; based on 30 specimens from stations 71, 81, 136, and 184: major diameter of test 135-246 µm, minor diameter 81-172 µm; length of axes of internal trizonal shells (8 specimens): P1 18-33 µm, P2 59- 95 µm, T1 14-18 µm, T2 39-74 µm.

	Remarks.  This species is identified as Larcopyle bütschlii on the basis of the internal pylonid structure and the presence of the cluster of spines at one pole.  Dreyer's illustration (1889, Pl. 10, fig. 70) differs from the Gulf forms in the smooth ellipsoidal shell with more regular pores.  In this respect it is more like Discopyle? sp. from the Gulf, but Dreyer (1889, p. 124) states that the internal structure is composed of trizonal shells, not pylodiscid shells.  It may be that Discopyle ? sp. and this species are the same, but due to problems of orientation the pylodiscid shell is difficult to recognize.

	Distribution.  Specimens identifiable as this species are generally rare but cosmopolitan in the Gulf, being absent at stations 192, 203, 208, and 214 and common at stations 106 and 206.  At station 206 the total population is only 201; therefore, results obtained from this station are not significantly comparable to those of other stations.  A significantly higher frequency (2.8%) was noted at station 106 which is located within the diatomite basin facies; therefore, this species may be controlled in part by upwelling.  It is almost common at stations 91, 92, and 93, located within and between areas of upwelling along both coasts.  Throughout the remainder of the Gulf this group does not undergo any significant changes in its frequency.  Because identification of these forms is difficult, interpretations regarding their distribution cannot be easily made.  It is cosmopolitan in the Gulf, and its distribution in local areas may be favored by upwelling.
Larcopyle bütschlii was described by Dreyer (1889, p. 125) from "Challenger" stations 232, 266, and 271.  The first is located off the east coast of Japan in the Kuroshio Current, the other two in the central equatorial Pacific.  This species, therefore, is at least tropical to temperate, but it has not been reported from polar latitudes.

<de_description><![CDATA[Larcospira minor:
This species has a very difference appearance, according to the position in which it is seen. In one position it has an appearance corresponding to the illustration referred to, and which caused me to consider it as a Lithelius with a double spiral. On being rolled under the microscope it has, in another position, the appearance of 3 distinct (concentric) shells, one outside the other, the innermost being somewhat oblong, the other two rounder. In this last position, an indefinite contour of an inner, smaller shell is seen in the innermost one. From which one may probably conclude that the innermost of the three shells is double, Larnacilla-shaped or trizonal (according to Haeckel's designations). I have not, however, succeeded in seeing this clearly. From this shell there extends, on both sides, a transverse girdel. Which winds itself into a spiral about the largest axis of the inner shell, the longitudinal or principal axis (after Haeckel). These tow spirals gave rise to the appearance of a Lithelius with a double, when looked at from above (transverse section, after Haeckel apical view). In a certain, a little oblique, position one gets again a more or less indefinite impression of a single spiral. In each spiral there is only a little more than one turn. Pores somewhat uneven, not large. Numerous, long, narrow, needleshaped radial spines. One of the most frequent radiolaria in the north, sometimes also rather numerous, especially in ocean samples.

Distribution: Also rather frequent on the west coast. Known too from a few places in the in the Norwegian Ocean, where it occurs together with southern forms.

NOTE: What is in one instance in the tables entered as Lithelius spiralis Haeckel is very uncertain, and it is probably only a form of Larcospira minor, which, as already mentioned, in certain positions gives the appearance of a single spiral. The same is the case with regard to L. spiralis Jørgensen (1900) p. 66.

Larcospira quadrangula Haeckel

Larcospira quadrangula Haeckel, 1887, Challenger Rept., Zool., vol. 18, p. 696, Pl. 49, fig. 3.

	Fully developed tests subquadrangular in outline but with a sagittal constriction.  Structure consisting of a double spiral representing a turning of two diagonally opposite wings of the second transverse girdle around the principal axis of the test; the other two wings of this girdle are absent.  The wings are attached proximally to two oppositely placed, cylindrical, polar (coaxial with principal shell axis) beams, each of which arises from the innermost ellipsoidal shell from which is developed the inner trizonal shell surrounding it; the two spiral wings of the second transverse girdle arise from the trizonal shell.  Each of the two wings are elongated parallel to the principal axis and form half-cylindroidal chambers whose openings face in opposite directions.  Wings (chambers) supported by several thin, cylindrical, radial beams which arise from the surface of the inner trizonal shell.  Lattice of test with subequal to unequal, subpolygonal pores, subregularly arranged, separated by thin intervening bars.  Surface of test with scattered thorns or short, thin, conical spines.

	Measurements; based on 13 specimens from stations 27, 34, 60, 81, 91, 106, and 184: length of P1 axis (innermost shell) 31-36 µm, of P2 axis (inner trizonal shell) 68-82 µm, of P3 axis (sagittal constriction of fully developed forms) 135-209 µm, of T1 axis 18-27 µm, of T2 axis 43-64 µm, of T3 axis (maximum breadth of fully developed tests) 125-246 µm.

	Remarks.  Haekel's illustration of this species does not show any differences from the Gulf specimens.  However, he placed L. quadrangula in his subgenus Larcospirema Haeckel (1887, p. 696) which he defines as comprising tests with only one wing of the transverse girdle turning around the principal axis.  His illustration, however, shows two wings turning around this axis.

	Distribution.  This species is rare in the Gulf, occurring only at stations 27, 34, 46, 56, 60, 81, 91, 92, 93, 106, 115, and 184.  Its near absence in the northern half of the Gulf indicates that it is an oceanic species.
	Haeckel reported this species from the central Pacific at Challenger station 265.  It has not been reported from high latitudes; therefore, it is probably restricted to tropical regions.

<de_description><![CDATA[Litharachnium tentorium:
The upper part of the lattice shell is slenderly conical, widened out below to a broad brim which is at the outside edge bent again upwards, giving the appearance of the brim of a hat. At the top of the conical part, there is a tiny semispherical cephalis.

The pores in the upper part of the shell are small, round and scattered; farther down they are lattice windows (as in the genus Plectopyramis HCK.) and are more regularly arranged in horizontal rows. The shape gradually lengthens out horizontally, so that from being round they become rectangular with rounded corners. Only still farther down do the straight ribs in the wall of the lattice shell appear, and the pores now become regularly rectangular, and are arranged in distinct rows, both radially and tangentially. When the radial pores have attained a certain size, new straight longitudinal ribs appear in the wall of the lattice shell, pushed in between the old ones.

The number of principal ribs in the well developed specimen which is illustrated in fig. 90, was 32. Very numerous secondary ribs, their number increasing in proportion to the distance from the cephalis, were present between these 32. The diameter of the brim 340 µm, of the cephalis only 8-9 µ. The largest meshes (high up) 9 µ, in the brim about 6 µ.

Notwithstanding, that there are really great differences in Haeckels and my descriptions, it seems - on account of the remarkable correspondence in so many details with Haeckels illustration - that my species and Haeckels are after all identical.

This species answers perhaps best in structure to the many-jointed genera (division Stichocyrtida), and might be considered as such a many-jointed form, where the strictures and annular septa between the different joints have disappeared.

Very rare, only singly: Skroven, 4/4 1899, 0-150 m.; the Folden Fiord, 6/4 1900, 300-200 m.

Distribution: In the sea between Norway and the Faeroe Isles (also mentioned from here by Cleve, L. 40 [1901]. Found by Haeckel at Messina.

Seems to be southern, temperate, oceanic form. ]]></de_description>

<de_description><![CDATA[Lithomelissa  hystrix:
Cephalis not very high, finally, by the development of secondary, outer arches in the region of the neck, a broad semisphere, which is half of it sunk into the thorax.
	
The thorax is above campanulate, below cylindrical, with two distinct, lateral indentations in the upper part.
	
In the region of the neck in younger individuals, there are large holes, which later on are, to some extent, closed, by the development of outer arches between the lower part of the cephalis and the upper part of the thorax. The pores outside this region of the neck are roundish, of very varying size, being smallest on the upper part of the cephalis.
	
On the whole, there appears to be the same spines as in L. setosa, but fewer really protruding ones from the inner skeleton. The thorax here too appears to be similarly formed to that of L. setosa, from strong, obliquely downwards pointing byspines on the primary arches. A number of such obliquely protruding byspines are also seen in this species in the region of the neck. In addition, there are also numerous, needle-shaped byspines on the cephalis and the upper part of the thorax, and these, on a broad part of the shell, between the cephalis and thorax, develop fine, connecting beams, covering the large neck openings.
	
The region of the neck will here, in this way, be surrounded by a covering which causes the cephalis finally to be half (or wholly?) sunk into the thorax. This outer covering is chiefly formed from byspines on secondary arches.
	
Cephalis 22µm broad, thorax 45-50µm broad. The height of the thorax in the forms occurring in my material 34-40µm. In these forms, which most probably were not fully developed, the brim of the thorax was provided beneath with short irregular spines, which no doubt are the walls of meshes in process of development.
	
It is a question whether this species should not be more correctly separated from the genus Lithomelissa. But as I have not as yet had an opportunity of studying the inner skeleton more carefully, I will, for the present, retain it in the genus in which I originally placed it.
	
Very rare and occurs only sparsely: 19/1-1899, 40 miles NW of Gaukværø, 0-700 m; 28/3-1899, the Tys Fiord I, 0-700 m.
	
Distribution: Also very rare on the west coast of Norway.

<de_description><![CDATA[Lithomelissa laticeps:
As yet, I am only imperfectly acquainted with this species which seems related to L. thoracites HCK. and L. mediterranea J. MÜLL. It differs from the preceding one in having a larger cephalis, which is broader and more obtuse, and by the want of byspines. Neither does there appear to be any other protruding spines than the principal ones, with perhaps a couple of branches. 

The thorax has no marginal byspines beneath. The pores here on the lower margin are larger and the walls thinner, so that probably the individual illustrated is not yet fully developed. 

Vary rare and only singly: Sea off Røst, 22/3 1899, 0-900m.

Distribution: I have seen it in a deep water sample from the sea between the Færø and Shetland Isles (cfr. above, p. 128).]]></de_description>

<de_description><![CDATA[Lithomelissa:
The four primary spines, A, D, Lr and Ll, are present, as well as the ventral, sagittal one.
	
The apical spine, D, runs in the wall of the cephalis, and protrudes like a needle-shaped tophorn, the lower part being inside the lattice shell. The dorsal, basal spine, A, protrudes obliquely like a simple spike (needle), rather far down on the thorax. On the inside, it is propped up against the shell by arch-shaped supporting beams (corresponding to the apical arches in Phormacantha hystrix). The lateral spines pierce the thorax in its upper part and protrude each of them as (one or?) two spikes.
	
The ventral, sagittal spine protrudes near the region of the neck (between cephalis and thorax), and is, in Lithomelissa setosa, connected to the right lateral spine, Ll, by an inner little lattice-plate, whilst it is farther distant from the left, lateral spine. In other words, it divides the angle between the lateral spines into two very uneven parts, one small one to the right, and a larger one to the left. By this feature, young forms of Lithomelissa setosa are easily recognized, even if only the cephalis be developed.
	
The primary arches between D, Lr and Ll are well developed, and protrude on the inside like three archshaped ledges, running upwards. By means of outwards and downwards bent byspines from these primary arches, together with branches and arches from the dorsa spine, A, and the lateral ones, the thorax is developed. In the upper part of the thorax, there are, therefore, formed three, more or less distinct swellings, a right one, below the primary, right, lateral arch, a left one, below the left, lateral arch, and a ventral one, below the primary, ventral arch.
	
Here too, as in all the forms of Cyrtoidea occurring in my material, there is an inner axial spine, pointing downwards vertically from the ventral end of the central rod, thus having the same starting point as the ventral, sagittal spine.

Lithomelissa setosa:	
Compare above the description of the genus and of the structure of the species in the introduction to the group Nassellaria. Cfr. too Jørgensen (1900) where a detailed description will be found.
	
Of byspines, there are usually too strongly developed one on the right, lateral arch, protruding in the form of simple spikes in the upper part of the thorax, one or two similar ones on the left, lateral arch, and a couple on the cephalis.
	
The spikes, which are seen in varying numbers and differently developed on the lower margin of the thorax are  at any rate most often  temporary formations. They disappear later on as the development of the thorax progresses, the meshes being formed between these spines. It is possible that var. belonophora Jørgensen (1900, pl. 4, fig. 22) is the fully developed form, and that its marginal spines are therefore permanent.
	
Frequent, mostly in deep water samples, sometimes  but rarely  in the surface. Rarely at all numerous.

Distribution: Belongs to the most frequent Radiolaria on the west coast of Norway.

Lithopera bacca Ehrenberg, 1873a, Akad. Berlin, Monatsb. (1872), pp. 314-315; 1873b, Akad. Berlin, Abhandl. (1872), Pl. 8, fig. 1; Popofsky, 1913, Deutsche Südpolar-Exped., vol. 14, pp. 355-356, text figs. 61-63.
Lithopera bursella Ehrenberg, 1873a, Akad. Berlin, Monatsb. (1872), p. 315; 1873b, Akad. Berlin, Abhandl. (1872), Pl. 10, fig. 4.
Lithopera ananassa Haeckel, 1887, Challenger Rept., Zoo!, vol. 18, p. 1234, Pl. 57, fig. 3.

	Test consisting of a spherical, generally rough cephalis which is half depressed within a broad, cylindrical to ovate thorax with a rounded closed mouth.  Pores of cephalis small, equal, polygonal to subcircular, hexagonally arranged, surrounded by polygonal frames, in a few tests infilled with silica.  A long, straight, vertical, generally conical, eccentric apical horn extends from the apical bar which is a dorsal cephalic rib occupying a slight dorsal sagittal furrow in the cephalis.  Vertical spine short, inconspicuous.  Collar ring heavy, with four small circular collar pores.  Dorsal and primary lateral bars extend from the collar ring as bars which are free within the thoracic cavity proximally, but distally they extend for a short distance as thoracic ribs coincident with slight furrows in the surface of the thorax; ribs terminate in short, inconspicuous spines at the level of maximum proximal curvature of the thorax.  In several specimens the distal portion of the thorax is marked by a transverse ridge separating its cylindrical portion from the lower, rounded or dome-shaped, closed portion (Pl. 33, fig. 10); this feature absent in a few tests.  Surface of thorax rough but without long spines in the few specimens observed.  Pores of thorax, including its dome-shaped distal portion, small, equal, hexagonal, hexagonally arranged in longitudinal rows, surrounded by hexagonal frames.

	Measurements; based on 3 specimens from stations 27 and 46: maximum length of test 132-135 µm, maximum breadth 92-117 µm; length of cephalis 27-28 µm, of thorax 117-123 µm, of apical horn 14-30 µm.

	Remarks.  The species listed in the synonymy differ from one another only slightly in the shape of the thorax.  Lithopera ananassa Haeckel differs only in the presence of thicker intervening bars and in longer spines originating from the nodes of the intervening bars of the thorax, both of which are subject to intraspecific variation.  Haeckel (1887, p. 1234) states that he observed the thoracic ribs in the specimen of Lithopera bursella Ehrenberg that he studied, but Ehrenberg did not.  None of the species have a transverse raised ridge on the distal portion of the thorax; this feature, however, is not present in all specimens from the Gulf.

	Distribution.  This species is very rare and occurs only at stations 27, 34, 46, 56, and 60 in the southern half of the Gulf.  It is, therefore, an oceanic species with little affinity for Gulf waters.
	This species is widespread in Recent tropical seas.  L. bacca occurs in the tropical Pacific at the surface ("Challenger" stations 200, 224, 266, 271), in the Philippine Sea, and in the western tropical Indian Ocean.  L. bursella was reported from the tropical Indian Ocean near Zanzibar.  L. ananassa was reported from the surface of the tropical Atlantic at "Challenger" stations 347-352.

Lithostrobus cf. hexagonalis Haeckel

?Lithostrobus hexagonalis Haeckel, 1887, Challenger Rept., Zool., vol. 18, p. 1475, Pl. 79, fig. 20.
?Spirocyrtis scalaris Haeckel, 1887, Challenger Rept., Zool., vol. 18, p.1509, Pl. 76, fig. 14.

	Relatively long, broad test with 5-8 or more joints.  The 4-5 joints below the cephalis campanulate but with angular shoulders coincident with their greatest breadth; joints increase in diameter distally.  Distal joint of fully-developed forms cylindrical, long, with or without a distinct constriction in its proximal portion.  Joints separated by distinct angular strictures; internal septal rings lacking.  Pores of all joints similar, of nearly equal size, hexagonal to subhexagonal, with or without short, thin thorns at the nodes of the intervening bars, with hexagonal arrangement in transverse rows, 3-4 rows on each of the proximal abdominal joints.  Pores of the thorax similar but slightly smaller than those of successive joints, arranged in 5-7 transverse rows.  Surface of test generally smooth except for thin, divergent, conical spines (1-12 µm) originating from the angular 
shoulder of each joint.  Cephalis cap-shaped to truncate-conical, with a few scattered thorns or spines, with pores similar to those of the thorax; not distinctly separated from the thorax; with two, three-bladed to conical, approximately equal apical and vertical horns lying in the sagittal plane, each extending from the apical and vertical bars, respectively, which are free within the cephalic cavity.  An indistinct dorsal lobe merging with the thorax is separated by a pair of lateral furrows in the wall of the cephalis that are coincident with indistinct ribs corresponding to the apical-lateral arches.  The dorsal and primary lateral bars extend as indistinct ribs in the thoracic wall that are prolonged as thin conical spines (5-21 µm) which originate from the angular shoulder of the thorax.  Mouth of the distal joint not constricted; terminal margin not observed complete.

	Measurements; based on 18 specimens from stations 27, 46, 60, and 81: maximum length of test 123-273 µm, maximum breadth (distal joint) 107-185 µm; length of cephalis (to median bar) 17-25 µm, of thorax 22-30 µm; breadth of cephalis 22-25 µm, of thorax 62-71 µm; length of apical horn 2-43 mm, of vertical horn 5-32 µm.

	Remarks.  Lithostrobus hexagonalis Haeckel from "Challenger" station 272 in the tropical central Pacific has joints that are similar to those of the Gulf species, but they are separated by septal rings which are located anound the broadest portion of each joint.  Thin, conical spines at the broadest portion of each joint are absent in Haeckel's species.  The cephalis is more nearly spherical and has only a single horn.  Spirocyrtis scalaris Haeckel from Challenger" stations 271-274 in the tropical central Pacific resembles the Gulf species in outline of the joints, but the transverse strictures between joints are connected in a spiral.  Internal septal rings are lacking as well as thin spines around the broadest portions of each joint.  The cephalis is much smaller than that of the Gulf species, but it has two horns lying in the sagittal plane.  Examination of the type material of both of these species is necessary before the Gulf species can be positively identified with either or both of them.

	Distribution.  This species is very rare but nearly cosmopolitan in the Gulf.  It is absent at stations 64, 71, 99, 130, 192, 194, and all those to the north.  It has a slightly but not significantly greater frequency in the southern half of the Gulf.  Whether or not its occurrence in the northern half of the Gulf is dependent only on upwelling in this region cannot be determined.  Its absence or very rare occurrence at marginal and northern shelf localities indicates its preference for more nearly oceanic offshore waters.

Lophocorys polyacantha Popofsky, 1913, Deutsche Südpolar-Exped., vol. 14, pp. 400-401, text fig. 122.
?Artopilium undulatum Popofsky, 1913, op. cit., pp. 405-406, Pl. 36, figs. 4, 5.

	Test with 3-5 joints that increase in breadth distally and are separated by broad constrictions without septal rings.  Individual joints in most tests with rounded shoulders or at least broader proximally and nearly cylindrical distally.
	Forms identical with Lophocorys polyacantha Popofsky and Artopilium undulatum Popofsky are included together because specimens corresponding to the latter are rare in the Gulf but are similar to the former in shape of joints and basic structure of the cephalis.  The relationships between these two forms are not clear, and further taxonomic study of them is needed.
	 Tests corresponding to the former species have large, subcircular to hexagonal pores that increase in size distally and are arranged hexagonally in longitudinal rows.  Cephalis subspherical to subcylindrical, relatively large, with subequal, hexagonal pores except for a pair of larger dorsal pores on either side of the apical bar in the wall of the cephalis; with a surface ranging from smooth to one with several, scattered, thin, conical spines.  A conical to three-bladed apical spine ascends dorsally from its origin on the dorsal face of the cephalis.  A short vertical spine generally inconspicuous.  Four collar pores present.  Dorsal and primary lateral bars extend as thoracic ribs that are prolonged as short, thin spines (3-12 µm) in most specimens.  In several tests there are 
1 to 2 joints below the cephalis, but the distal joint is long, cylindrical to truncate-conical, and without constrictions.  Surface of a few tests smooth, but in most tests with scattered thin, conical spines (2-22 µm).  Mouth of test not constricted; terminal margin incomplete.
	
	Measurements; based on 14 specimens from stations 46, 60, 64, 81, 93, 106, and 151: maximum length of test 111-200 µm, maximum breadth 74-117 µm; length of cephalis 21-34 µm, breadth 25-34 µm; length of apical spine or horn 2-37 µm.

	Distribution.  This species or species-group is rare but nearly cosmopolitan in the Gulf.  It is absent at stations 27, 90, 95, 99, 130, 191, 194, and all those to the north.  Its absence at marginal localities and its slightly greater frequency in the axial portion of the Gulf indicate its preference for more nearly oceanic, offshore waters.  It undergoes no significant fluctuations in its frequency throughout the Gulf.
	This species or species-group is widespread in Recent tropical seas.  Lophocorys polyacantha Popofsky and Artopilum undulatum Popofsky are both reported from the tropical Atlantic Ocean, the latter from the tropical Indian Ocean as well.

Ceratospyris polygona Haeckel

Three variations of the bilocular cephalis are present in this species.  The majority of specimens have large polygonal pores separated by three-bladed intervening bars from the nodes of which arise three-bladed spines (Pl. 22, figs. 15-16) [= Lophospyris pentagona pentagona].  The number and size of pores are variable; two pairs of large pores are present on the dorsal, upper, and ventral sides of the sagittal constriction, the pores of each pair separated by the sagittal ring.  

[Lophospyris pentagona hyperborea]:

The second form has the large polygonal pores on either side of the sagittal ring that are separated by three-bladed bars, but the lateral portion of each lobe is composed of a smooth, rounded, small-pored lattice (Pl. 22, fig. 18).  The third variation of the cephalis is represented by a few specimens having large, subequal, circular pores, but the intervening bars separating them have traces of a three-bladed cross-sectional shape (Pl. 22, fig. 17); most of these specimens have spines arising from the nodes of the intervening bars; this form may represent a response to an increase in dissolved silica in the surface waters of the Gulf.

	Three variations of the bilocular cephalis are present in this species.  The majority of specimens have large polygonal pores separated by three-bladed intervening bars from the nodes of which arise three-bladed spines (Pl. 22, figs. 15-16).  The number and size of pores are variable; two pairs of large pores are present on the dorsal, upper, and ventral sides of the sagittal constriction, the pores of each pair separated by the sagittal ring.  The second form has the large polygonal pores on either side of the sagittal ring that are separated by three-bladed bars, but the lateral portion of each lobe is composed of a smooth, rounded, small-pored lattice (Pl. 22, fig. 18).  The third variation of the cephalis is represented by a few specimens having large, subequal, circular pores, but the intervening bars separating them have traces of a three-bladed cross-sectional shape (Pl. 22, fig. 17); most of these specimens have spines arising from the nodes of the intervening bars; this form may represent a response to an increase in dissolved silica in the surface waters of the Gulf.  All three types of cephalis have the same structure of the collar ring and sagittal ring.  Four large collar pores, cardinal and cervical pores, are similar in size to those of Petalospyris cf. ophirensis  but with polygonal outline and separated by three-bladed, not cylindrical, bars.  In fully developed forms, seven downward-divergent, three-bladed to conical feet of variable length arise at an angle from the collar ring, and correspond to the dorsal, secondary lateral, cardinal, and primary lateral feet or spines of P. cf. ophirensis.  A pair of nearly horizontal, three-bladed to conical, ventrally extending spines are present in most specimens, each spine originating from the ventro-lateral corner of the collar ring as in P. cf. ophirensis.  The primary and secondary lateral bars extend as and are collinear with short, thin, three-bladed to conical spines.  Sagittal ring three-bladed, with one blade in the sagittal plane projecting inward, two blades extending laterally outwards from which originate the bars of the latticed cephalis; ring approximately D-shaped but asymmetrical; median bar short, generally cylindrical, with a short axial thorn; a three-bladed to conical apical spine of variable length extends from and is collinear with the vertical, straight apical bar; in all tests a pair of laterally ascending accessory spines are present, each spine originating from the base of the apical spine on its right and left, in their proximal portions represented by intervening bars separating the upper dorsal pair of sagittal cephalic pores from the dorsal pair of sagittal pores of the upper face of the cephalis; a. three-bladed to conical vertical spine of variable length extends from and is collinear with the vertical bar of the sagittal ring.

	Measurements; based on 30 specimens from stations 92 and 93: sagittal height of cephalis 50-82 µm, maximum breadth 96-163 µm; length of feet 5-100 µm (generally 20-40 µm), of apical spine 3-15 µm, of vertical spine 5-25 µm.

	Remarks.  The species listed in the synonymy are all characterized by three-bladed bars and spines and a variable but maximum number of seven three-bladed feet or short spines corresponding to feet.  The number and size of polygonal pores of the cephalis are not constant within the Gulf species.  The above species were separated by Haeckel on the basis of these variable characters; therefore, they were placed in synonymy.
	The three variations of the latticed cephalis may represent subspecies but most likely represent individual variations.  All three types were considered as belonging to the same species because they have the same structure of the sagittal and collar rings and the same number of feet and primary spines.

	Distribution.  This species is cosmopolitan in the Gulf but rare at all stations where it occurs except 115 where it is common (2.6%).  It is absent at stations 64, 130, 184, 194, and all those to the north.  It has a greater frequency in the axial portion of the Gulf and does not appear to respond to upwelling because it is absent or very rare at stations located within regions of upwelling.  It has about the same average frequency throughout the entire Gulf but prefers an offshore habitat.
	Haeckel (1887, p. 1067) states that C. polygona is cosmopolitan, occurring at the surface of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans.  Popofsky (1913, p. 307) reported the same species from the tropical part of the western Indian Ocean and from the equatorial Atlantic.  C. mulderi Haeckel (1887, p. 1067) was reported from the Indian Ocean in the Sunda Straits.  Popofsky (1913, p. 309) reported the same species from the tropical part of the western Indian Ocean.  C. allmersii Haeckel (1887, p . 1067) was reported from the tropical Atlantic at "Challenger" station 347.  C. strasburgerii Haeckel (1887, p. 1068) was reported from the western tropical Pacific at "Challenger" station 225.  The species from the Gulf, therefore, is cosmopolitan in recent tropical seas.

Ceratospyris cf. pentagona Ehrenberg

?Ceratospyris pentagona Ehrenberg, 1872a, Akad. Berlin, Moriatsb. (1872), p. 303; 1872b, Akad. Berlin, Abhandl. (1872), Pl. 10, fig. 15.

	The structure and shape of the collar ring, collar pores, and sagittal ring are the same as in Ceratospyris polygona.  Seven foot-like spines, conical to three-bladed, correspond to those of C. polygona but are generally shorter.  Major differences 
between this species and C. polygona are: (1) the presence of thinner intervening bars of the cephalis that are generally circular in section with none or only a few three-bladed; (2) the presence of fewer but larger pores of the cephalis; (3 ) the presence of two pairs of very large polygonal pores, each pair separated by the sagittal ring, on the dorsal face of the cephalis, these pores being much larger than those of C. polygona; the bars separating the lower from the upper pair on the dorsal face are absent or rudimentary in several specimens; therefore, in these forms only one pair of large sagittal pores are present; (4) in many tests the presence of only one pair of large, polygonal sagittal pores on the ventral face of the cephalis; (5) the straight not convex upward outline of the upper surface of each lobe of the cephalis; this is represented by heavy, straight bars originating from the base of the apical spine on its right and left and corresponding to those of C. polygona, occupying the upper dorsal edge of the cephalis; the bars extend laterally and are either horizontal or ascend at a small angle and continue as thin conical spines; the bars extend nearly to the lateral limits of the bi-lobed cephalis in contrast to the short bars of C. polygona; a pair of similar bars are present in most specimens at the upper ventral edge of the cephalis; (6) the presence of few, if any, spines arising from the surface of the cephalis; and (7) a smaller, less variable maximum breadth of the cephalis.

	Measurements; based on 25 specimens from stations 71 and 133: sagittal height of cephalis 47-68 µm, maximum breadth 73-98 µm; length of feet 5-23 µm, of apical spine 0-36 µm, of vertical spine 5-15 µm. 

	Remarks.  Ehrenbergs illustration of Ceratospyris pentagona (1872b, Pl.10, fig. 15) is similar to the Gulf species in the lack of three-bladed bars and the presence of short spines or feet.  His drawing lacks details, however, and the feet are not differentiated from the surface spines.  The presence of pentagonal pores may not be of specific value, although the sagittal pores of the Gulf species are generally pentagonal. 

	Distribution.  This species is rare in the Gulf but occurs as far north as station 191.  It is present but rare at stations 34, 46, 81, 92, 93, 106, 115, 133, 136, 151, and 191.  Its absence and rare occurrence in the southern half of the Gulf but its greater frequency at stations located in the diatomite facies of the northern Gulf indicates that it responds to upwelling there.  Its generally rare occurrence indicates its little affinity for Gulf waters.
	Ehrenberg (1872a, p. 303) reported C. pentagona from the Indian Ocean near Zanzibar.  Haeckel (1887, p.1067) later reported this species as cosmopolitan, occurring at the surface of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans.  Due to the uncertain identification of the Gulf species, nothing can be stated about its world-wide distribution except that it is present in the eastern tropical Pacific.

Schale etwas unsymmetrisch glockenförmig, mit viereckiger Mündung. Die vier Oralstacheln (Füsse) paarweise an der Spitze mit einander verbunden und auf diese Weise zwei runde, nach unten zu divergirende Bügel bildend. Jeder Bügel trägt sechs bis zehn radiäre Stacheln, deren Grösse mit der Entfernung von der Schalenmündung abnimmt und die mit zahlreichen kleinen Dornen besetzt sind. Am aboralen Pole besitzt die Schale einen langen, etwas unregelmässig gebogenen Apicalstachel, der bis fünf  oder noch mehr mal so lang als die Schale ist. Der Apicalstachel weist an seiner Oberfläche eine mehr oder minder grosse Zahl kleiner Dornen auf, die bisweilen fast gänzlich fehlen.

Grössenverhältnisse: Länge der Schale 0,048-0,060 mm, Breite derselben an der Mündung etwa ebenso gross. 

Fundort: Norwegische Westküste (Herlöfjord, Hjeltefjord, Byfjord, Hardangerfjord, Puddefjord, Bulandet).

Es ist bei der bedeutenden Uebereinstimmung in der äusseren Gestalt sowie auch in der Grösse der Schale nicht unwahrscheinlich, dass diese Art mit der von mir 1901 aus dem Mittelmeer beschriebenen Medusetta parthenopaea identisch ist. Bei der letzteren trägt jedoch der Apicalstachel kleine Bäumchen mit Ankerfäden, ebenso ist die Oberfläche der Schale mit feinen Stacheln besetzt. Auch sonst bestehen noch unwesentlichere Verschiedenheiten, so lässt beispielsweise die nordische Form nach der Abbildung Jörgensen's die kleinen Zacken an der Spitze der von den oralen Füssen entspringenden radiären Stacheln vermissen und der unregelmässige Besatz von kurzen Dornen an den Bügeln fehlt vollkommen. Alle diese Gebilde sind aber aufserordentlich zart, so dass sie leicht abbrechen oder auch übersehen werden.]]></de_description>

<de_description><![CDATA[Mitrocalpis araneafera:
Schale aus nur einem Köpfchen bestehend, eiförmig, gegen die enge Mündung zugespitzt, am aboralen Pole breiter, aus unregelmässig runden oder polygonalen, mit ausgerundeten Ecken versehenen Maschen bestehend. Poren von sehr verschiedener Grösse. Die dazwischenliegenden Gitterbalken ziemlich dünn. Maschen am weitesten an dem oralen Pol, also an der Mündung der Schale. Auf der inneren Schale erhebt sich, zerstreut über die ganze Oberfläche derselben, eine grosse Zahl kurzer Stacheln, die in einiger Entfernung von der inneren Schale eine unregelmässige zweite Hülle bilden, welche wie zartes Spinnengewebe die innere Schale umgibt. Die Oberfläche dieser zweiten Hülle ist nicht glatt, sondern unregelmässig. Wie die am Rand stehenden Stacheln zeigen, können auch benachbarte Stacheln ineinanderfliessen und noch Poren einschliessen. Nach der Schalenmündung zu nimmt das Spinngewebe ab, um an der Mündung ganz zu verschwinden, so dass dort nur die Stacheln sichtbar sind. Diese sind hier etwas gösser, als sie an den sonstigen Teilen der Schale sind. In der Figur (Taf. XXX, Fig. 11) ist die zweite äussere Spinngewebhülle nur am Rand im Quersehnitt gezeichnet. 

Masse: Länge der inneren Schale 0,21mm. Breite derselben 0.133mm.
Vorkommen: Deutche Südpolar-Expedition. Fahrt im Eise 13. Marz 1903, 0-300m; ein Exemplar.

Die neue Art unterscheidet sich von der einzigen bisher bekannten Mitrocalpis palliata H. durch die bedentend geringeren Dimensionen, ferner dadurch, dass die Oberfläche der zweiten Hülle nicht glatt, sonden mehr ungleichmässig ist, dass weiter der Schalenmund eine Anzahl grösserer Beistacheln trägt. ]]></de_description>

Neosemantis distephanus (Haeckel) Popofsky

Semantis distepahanus Haeckel, 1887, Challenger Rept., Zool, vol. 18, p. 957, Pl. 83, fig. 3.
Neosemantis distephanus Popofsky, 1913, Deutsche Südpolar-Exped., Vol. 14, p. 299, Pl. 29, fig. 2.

	Test consisting of three hemi-cardioid rings, separated by approximately equal angles, meeting at a common point, apically, and arising from the median bar, basally.  One ring lies in the sagittal plane and arises from the dorsal end of the short median bar, therefore corresponding to a half sagittal ring; the other two rings arise from the ventral end of the median bar and correspond in position to the primary lateral spines.  A thin, three-bladed dorsal spine with short thorns along the blades arises from the dorsal end of the median bar and extends dorsally downward in the plane of the half sagittal ring; a short axial spine or thorn is present; apical and vertical spines are lacking.  Median bar generally cylindrical but three-bladed in a few specimens.  The three half-rings of similar size and shape, relatively thin, three-bladed, with numerous thorns or thin conical spines of variable length (3-55 µm) arising from the blades, longer spines concentrated near the base of the rings, in a few specimens with one on each lateral ring that may correspond to a primary lateral spine.

	Measurements; based on 30 specimens from stations 71, 92, 106, and 133: height of rings 62-103 µm, maximum breadth between two of the rings 52-107 µm, length of dorsal spine 9-64 µm.

	Remarks.  Haeckel (1887, p. 957) interpreted Semantis distephanus as having a median bar which he states is not drawn distinctly enough in his illustration (op. cit., Pl. 83, fig. 3).  Haeckel' s illustration also lacks the dorsal spine, but if this were broken or not fully developed it would have escaped his attention. This species does not have two basal pores but instead three fused half-rings united at two places; therefore, it corresponds to Neosemantis  Popofsky, not Semantis Haeckel.  For these reasons Haeckel's species is placed in synonymy with Neosemantis distephanus Popofsky.  Popofsky's (1913, Pl. 29, fig. 2) illustration of this species agrees in all details with the Gulf species.  Popofsky's interpretation differs from mine, however, in that he named the wrong half ring (corresponding to the left primary lateral bar) as the sagittal ring and did not observe the median bar which is distinguishable but only in side view.

	Distribution.  This species is rare in the Gulf but occurs as far north as station 208, therefore, it is to some extent cosmopolitan but occurs at more stations in the northern half of the Gulf than in the southern half.  It is present at stations 60, 64, 81, 91, 92, 93, 106, 115, 133, 151, 184, 191, 192, and 208.  It has a slightly greater frequency at stations located within the diatomite facies, but this is not evident in the numerical data.  It probably represents a very rare species of the eastern tropical Pacific fauna but occurs throughout the Gulf because of its response to upwelling.
	Popofsky reported Neosemantis distephanus from the western tropical part of the Indian Ocean and from the tropical Atlantic Ocean.  Haeckel reported Semantis distephanus also from the tropical Atlantic.  The occurrence of this species in the Gulf makes it a cosmopolitan tropical species.  It has not been reported from high latitudes.

Nephrodictyum renilla (Haeckel)

Nephrospyris renilla Haeckel, 1887, Challenger Rept., Zool., vol. 18, p.1101, Pl. 90, figs. 9, 10.

	Large, discoidal test with a deep sagittal constriction in its outline at the basal pole, giving the test a reniform shape.  Sagittal ring centrally located; three-bladed except for a short, cylindrical median bar; asymmetrical with a straight, vertical apical bar, a straight, ventrally ascending vertical bar, and an angulated superior bar; latticed portion of test surrounds lateral, apical, and basal sides of ring, therefore, median bar internal; longest axis of test the lateral axis, intermediate axis the apical-basal axis, and shortest axis the dorsal-ventral axis.  Latticed reniform test originates from paired lateral bars arising at four nodes from the sagittal ring, one corresponding in position to the secondary lateral spines, one each at the upper corners of the ring, and a fourth at the near distal termination of the vertical bar.  Median bar with a pair of short, thin, conical or thorn-like primary lateral spines, a short stub of an axial spine, a free, thin, conical dorsal spine; a short, thin, conical vertical spine or thorn extends from and is collinear with the vertical bar; the apical spine represented by a bar which branches distally to form part of the test lattice.  Dorsal and ventral surfaces of test with large paired pores on either side of the sagittal ring; remainder of lattice with smaller but relatively large, unequal pores of irregular shapes, separated by thin, smooth intervening bars, circular in section.  The lateral bars arising from the sagittal ring do not form horizontal rings but outline the large pores of the test on either side of the sagittal ring.  Surface of test smooth but irregular.

	Measurements; based on 2 specimens from stations 34 and 56: longest axis (maximum lateral extent) 332-387 µm.; maximum height (apical-basa1, not measured in sagittal axis) 225-299 µm; sagittal axis (1 specimen) 198 µm; height of sagittal ring (1 specimen) 86 µm; length of vertical spine 6 mm, of dorsal spine 6 µm, of primary lateral spines 11-16 µm.

	Remarks.  The Gulf specimens differ from Haeckel's illustration of N. renilla only in the presence of larger pores of the lattice.  Haeckel (1887, Pl. 90, fig. 10) illustrates a specimen, presumably of this species, with the skeleton reduced to the sagittal ring only but with a kidney-shaped calymma.  Although the ring may be present in the Gulf sediments it is not identifiable as this species.

	Distribution.  This species is very rare in the Gulf.  Only four specimens were observed, one each at stations 34, 46, 56, and 60. It is, therefore, an oceanic species.
	Haeckel reported this species from the central Pacific at "Challenger" station 274. No other record of its occurrence was found in the literature.

Octopyle stenozona Haeckel

Octopyle stenozona Haeckel, 1887, Challenger Rept., Zool., vol. 18, p. 652, P1. 9, fig. 11.

	Test subquadrate in outline, with one complete system of inner dimensive girdles with elliptical outline in frontal view and with the second transverse girdle complete as well as most of the second lateral girdle; the lateral girdle has short spines or thorns, parallel to the sagittal axis extending from it in the region of the poles of the principal axis, suggestive of a rudimentary second sagittal girdle; however, no specimens from the Gulf were observed with this girdle.  Second transverse and lateral girdles very narrow, with large unequal pores separated by heavy intervening bars; surface of both girdles with short, stout spines or thorns, unbranched distally.  Test typically with a pair of heavy, cylindrical beams, oppositely placed, coaxial with the principal axis of the test, each arising from the surface of the innermost ellipsoidal shell and joining with the second lateral girdle distally; the presence of the beams gives the test the appearance of having eight subcircular gates, four on each side of the test, whereas there are only four true gates, two each on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the test.

	Measurements; based on 8 specimens from stations 27, 34, 46, and 71 [see Benson, 1966, text-fig. 18 under Tetrapyle octacantha group]: length of P1 axis 15-18 µm, of P2 axis 43-52 µm, of P3 axis 123-191 µm, of T1 axis 11-14 µm, of T2 axis 34-41 µm, of T3 axis 119-154 µm.

	Remarks.  Although rare in the Gulf this species is easily distinguished from Tetrapyle octacantha by its very narrow second transverse and lateral girdles, very short sagittal axis relative to the principal and transverse axes, its generally quadrangular outline, and by the presence of the two heavy polar beams which occupy the principal axis and give the test the appearance of having eight gates instead of four.  Haeckel (1887, p. 652) misinterpreted the polar beams as each representing a sagittal septum, but his illustration shows that they are beams (op. cit., P1. 9, fig. 11).

	Distribution. This species is very rare in the Gulf.  It is present only in the southern half of the Gulf at stations 27, 34, 46, 56, 71, 81, 91, and 106.  It is, therefore, an oceanic species.
	Haeckel reported Octopyle stenozona from the tropical Atlantic at "Challenger" station 338.  It has not been reported from high latitudes and is apparently confined to tropical regions.

Die äusseren (hier oberen) aeste der vorder- und hinterstacheln (zum oben erwähnten dreigliedrigen astwirtel gehörig, vergleiche oben unter Periplecta intricata) sind in kurze dorne umgewandelt; der entsprechende ast des mittelstachels dagegen lang, auslaufend.

Wie an Periplecta intricata findet man auch hier einen kräftigen hinterbogen zwischen dem mittel- und dem hinterstachel, einen ähnlichen vorderbogen sammt einem hauptbogen, der mit dem vorderbogen einen kurzen gemeinsamen, vom vorderstachel nach unten entspringenden stamm, besitzt. Auch hier ist kein direkter zusammenhang zwischen dem hinter- und dem hauptbogen vorhanden; jeder derselben entspricht einem ast der erwähnten dreigliedrigen wirtel.

Von oben her geschen zeigen sich also drei grosse maschen, nach aussen von den drei primären bögen begrenzt. Dann folgt die gitterschaale, die unter dem auslaufenden theil der basalstacheln grössere poren aufweist.

<de_description><![CDATA[Phormacantha hystrix:
The primary spines and primary arches as in Plectacantha oikiskos. The ventral arch and the left, lateral one also here run together to a strong, basal arch branch from the left, lateral main spine.
	
Outside the ventral, sagittal spine, there is an extended network of numerous, secondary meshes, which both below and on the sides are connected by the fine transverse beams to a corresponding one on the sides of the dorsal sagittal spine. In this way a network is formed, which is imperfectly closed beneath.
	
There are numerous byspines. Between these and the larger beams more or less numerous and mostly thin, arch-shaped, connecting beams are extended, which are in their turn here and there connected by similar, arched, fine beams, which at a later stage of development are provided with numerous, fine spines. These are, possibly, later, at any rate to some extent, developed to similar fine connecting arches, which more or less completely envelope the network.
	
The development of the arches is here further advanced than in Plectacantha oikiskos. From the three branches of the apical spine, arch branches extend, the apical arches, one to the dorsal, basal spine, and two to the primary, lateral arches. These apical arches may at the corners, as well towards the apical spine, as towards the dorsal one and the primary arches, be enveloped by similar arches. Cfr. also Jørgensen 1. c. p. 77.
	
At a younger stage, this species strongly resembles Plectacantha oikiskos. The ventral, sagittal spine, however, makes it easy to distinguish between them. At an older stage, they are so different that they can hardly be confounded. It is likely that there is more than one species which belongs here.
	
This form is very interesting, clearly being a connecting one between the groups Plectoidea and Monocyrtida. I formerly considered it to belong to the genus Peridium, and there is hardly any great or important difference in the structure of the genera Peridium and Phormacantha. It seems, however, most practicable to separate the imperfectly latticed forms from those which have a regularly developed lattice work which is closed beneath.	
	
On the other hand, this genus  as more fully explained in the introductory remarks to Nassellaria  forms clearly a transition to the genera Euscenium HCK. and Cladoscenium HCK. When the apical arches are further developed, an enclosed spine will result, a "columella".
	
The larger forms have a "network", which is about 70µ in height. Rather frequent, though never numerous, in deep water samples.

	Bilocular cephalis, with scattered short thorns or spines and small, unequal, circular to elliptical pores; separated from a truncate-conical thorax by a collar stricture.  Pores of the thorax similar to those of the cephalis.  Sagittal ring asymmetrical, with a straight, vertical apical bar which extends as a thin, conical to three-bladed apical spine; ring three-bladed in section except for a short cylindrical median bar.  A conical vertica1 spine or thorn present.  Six collar pores present; as in Desmospyris anthocyrtoides the jugular pores covered by a small, dorsal, sagittal cephalic lobe.  The dorsal and primary lateral bars extend as ribs in the wall of the thorax and terminate as three-bladed to conical spines or feet projecting downward from the thoracic margin; thorax slightly lobate between the three thoracic ribs.  The primary lateral bars as well as the secondary lateral bars also extend as and are collinear with short conical spines which arise from the collar stricture.  A few accessory terminal spines extend from the margin of the thorax in most specimens.

	Measurements; based on 5 specimens from station 71 and 106: sagittal height of cephalis 37-49 µm, maximum breadth 79-96 µm; length of thorax 49-90 µm, maximum breadth 86-96 µm; length of apical spine 5-12 µm, of vertical spine 2-15 µm, of terminal foot-like spines 12-37 µm.

	Remarks.  Haeckel (1887, p. 1087, Pl. 83, fig. 15) neither described nor illustrated the small dorsal sagittal cephalic lobe of Phormospyris tricostata.  This structure, however, is visible only in certain orientations; therefore, Haeckel may have overlooked it.  Haeckel's illustration shows a broader conical thorax than that of the Gulf species, but this is a variable character.  Other than these differences the Gulf species and P. tricostata Haeckel are identical.

	Distribution.  This species is very rare in the Gulf.  It occurs only at stations 71, 81, 92, 106, 115, 133, and 136; therefore, it is a rare member of the southern Gulf oceanic assemblage.  Its occurrence north of station 92 may indicate that it responds to the upwelling there but its generally rare occurrence makes analysis of this impossible.
	Haeckel (1887, p. 1087) reported this species from the central Pacific at "Challenger station 272.  It has not been reported from high latitudes; therefore, it is probably a tropical species.

<de_description><![CDATA[Plectacantha oikiskos:

Periplecta intricata (CL.) JÖRG. L. 90, p. 73.
Peridium (?) intricatum CL. L. 30, pl. 2, f. 8 a, b?
Peridium (?) laxum CL. 1. c, pl. 2, f. 9 a, b.

The primary verticil of branches of the apical spine has (generally?) only two branches, pointing upwards and outwards in the angle between the dorsal, basal spine and the lateral ones. These two branches together with the protruding middle stem form three undivided spikes, about equal in length. 

The left, lateral spine, Ll, Has the primary verticil complete. Of these three branches, however, the inside one is  as previously mentioned  transformed onto a short, strong arch, pointing downwards, at the end of which the left, lateral arch and the primary, ventral one meet. The two other branches form with the protruding middle stem, three, diverging, long, single spikes, pointing obliquely outwards and to the sides. By these three long, protruding spikes, the left, lateral spine may always be easily recognized. 

The right, lateral spine has only retained one branch of the verticil in its original form, the other two being branches for the two corresponding, primary arches, one belonging to the ventral arch, the other to the right, lateral one. There are consequently here two long, simple spikes, about equal in length, the outer branch in the primary verticil and the protruding, middle stem. 

The dorsal, basal spine has only one simple branch of the verticil, pointing outwards and upwards, the two others being strong, arched branches, diverging nearly at right angle on both sides. 

One of these branches forms the right, the other the left lateral arch. The middle stem of the basal spine is here branched, there being one or two similar secondary arches outside the primary, lateral ones. The dorsal, basal spine, therefore, only shows one simple, protruding spike. A similar, smaller byspine is generally to be found father out. 

The dorsal spine is the longest and strongest, the apical one the shortest and weakest. 

Outside the primary meshes, secondary ones are developed more or less richly, varying considerably in size. These unite to form a network which is generally rather imperfect, but would seem, on older individuals, to be made more complete by the addition of connecting beams across the larger, secondary meshes, so that these meshes finally are smaller in size and more in number. Generally speaking, the network is conically expanded downwards, and seems, in the case of older individuals, finally to be imperfectly closed beneath by the development of a few, fine, long, transverse beams. In the material examined specimens with such nearly closed network were always rare. 

Of the more important byspines and secondary meshes, I will only mention the following which seem always to be present, and may serve to help in identifying the species. Under the protruding right lateral spine a large, secondary, pentagonal mesh will be found. The left, lateral arch has strong byspines in the middle, pointing outwards and upwards, and under it, there is a large, secondary mesh. On both sides of the dorsal spine, outside the primary, lateral arches, on the left side will be found two secondary meshes, and on the right side one; the latter being the larges, but it is prehaps later on divided into two. 

Moreover, on all the stronger arches, there is a more or less rich development of byspines, pointing outwards and upwards, sometimes twins, directed upwards-outwards and downwards-outwards. 

The beams are thin in young individuals, especially at the outer secondary meshes; they are much stronger on older individuals. The length of the basal, dorsal spine is +/- 55µ.

Cfr. Jörgensen 1900.

I considered this species first to belong to the genus Periplecta HCK.; but as I later on found that what with HAECKEL characterizes this genus is also characteristic of all closely related genera, as I am acquainted with them from plankton samples (not drawings), I have been obliged to change the name of the genus.

I at first considered this species to be CLEVEs Peridium intricatum, and this may be correct, but it cannot be proved to be so from CLEVEs illustration nor from his description. As it is, moreover, quite as probable that CLEVEs Peridium (?) laxum also belongs to this species, I consider it best to retain the manuscript name I originally had given the species before CLEVEs work was published.

Not rare, but always in small numbers.

Distribution: Not rare on the west coast of Norway, always scarce. Probably boreal oceanic.]]></de_description>

<de_description><![CDATA[Plectacantha trichoides:
I have only in imperfect knowledge of this species, as I have only seen a few specimens, and at first took these to belong to the preceding species (Plectacantha oikiskos).

It has the same primary spines and primary arches; but there appears to be the important difference that the ventral, primary arch and the left, lateral arch both extend to the left, lateral spine, not to a common basal branch from the latter. On the other hand, there is a strong, secondary arch between the left, lateral one and the nearest side of the primary, ventral one.

In outer appearance, this species is very different from the foregoing one. Instead of the numerous secondary meshes, long connecting arches are developed, which form together a longish, ovate, very imperfect network of long, fine arches. The largest and strongest of these ran between the two lateral arches and form a very large, ovate mesh, pointing downwards. On its sides, especially in a ventral direction, similar large meshes are, developed, bounded by fine arch branches, which run from the primary arches to the said large, secondary one, or between secondary arches. On these arch branches, very fine spines are scattered, these probably later on being, developed into arch branches between the secondary arches. It is likely that a network will appear which is imperfectly closed beneath by basal, secondary arches, on elder individuals.

On the primary, basal spines, short byspines are also found on the pieces inside the primary arches.

This species is undoubtedly different from the foregoing. It is not certain whether it should be reckoned as belonging to the same genus; but it wants, as does the foregoing one, the ventral, sagittal spine.

Very rare and scarce, though certainly to some extent overlooked: 19/1 1899, 40 miles NW of Gaukværø, 0-700 m.

Distribution: Also on the west coast of Norway, but only occasionally and in small numbers.]]></de_description>

Dictyophimus platycephalus Haeckel

Dictyophimus platycephalus Haeckel, 1887, Challenger Rept., Zool., vol. 18, p. 1198, Pl. 60, figs. 4,5.
?Dictyophimus brandtii Haeckel, 1887, op. cit., p. 1198, Pl. 60, fig. 6.

	Cephalis subhemispherical or cap-like, small, barely distinguishable except for a ventral stricture separating it from a very broadly conical but short thorax developed between three widely splayed feet.  Cephalis smooth with small, unequal, subcircular pores; with a nearly vertical apical spine or horn extending from the straight apical bar of the short dorsal cephalic face which is almost completely covered by the two dorso-lateral lobes of the upper part of the thorax; a thin, conical, generally short vertical spine arises from the ventral stricture between cephalis and thorax and ascends ventrally.  Thorax developed between the three feet, with three lobes proximally, each lobe present between the dorsal and primary lateral thoracic ribs; with a smooth lattice consisting of subequal, circular to elliptical pores with subregular arrangement; basal mouth of thorax incomplete, subtriangular in section, not constricted, in a few tests with short, tooth-like, terminal spines.  The three feet broadly splayed, each with sharp outward convexity; distally, they point downward; proximally, they extend downward at a low angle from the horizontal.  Because the thoracic lattice is developed between the feet, the feet arise terminally instead of above the mouth of the thorax.  Four relatively large collar pores; collar ring, which consists of the apical-lateral arches and the ventral arch, is represented by indistinct ribs occupying the stricture between cephalis and thorax.

	Measurements; based on 6 specimens from stations 106, 133, 136, and 151: length of cephalis 16-21 µm, of thorax 27-39 µm; breadth of cephalis 16-23 µm, of thorax 52-91 µm; length of apical spine 31-46 µm; of vertical spine 0-15 µm, of feet 37-68 µm.

	Remarks.  The differences between this species and Diçtyophimus graciljpes Bailey were discussed in the remarks concerning the latter species.  The size of this species including the feet and apical and vertical spines is smaller than D. gracilipes; the range in breadth of the thorax of this species is also greater than in D. gracilipes.  A few specimens were observed with a nearly poreless cephalis and thorax (nearly hyaline).

	Distribution.  This species occurs more rarely in the Gulf than D. gracilipes.  Its greatest frequency was observed at station 106.  It has a slightly greater frequency at stations located within the diatomite facies, particularly, stations 106, 115, 133, 136, and 151.  It is absent at all stations north of 151.  It is very rare in the southern Gulf; therefore, its higher frequency in the northern Gulf may be explained by upwelling.
	Haeckel (1887, p. 1198) reported this species from the Atlantic Ocean near the Canary Islands.  D. brandtii Haeckel, which may be conspecific with this species, was reported from the north Pacific (loc. cit.).  Because D. platycephalus has not been reported from high latitudes it is apparently a tropical to temperate species, present in all oceans.

Pterocanium cf. elegans (Haeckel)

?Artopilium elegans Haeckel, 1887, Challenger Rept., Zool., vol. 18, p. 1440, Pl. 75, fig. 1.

	Test consisting of three joints, a cephalis, thorax and abdomen; with heavy, long, three-bladed apical and vertical horns and three feet originating from near or above the base of the thorax.  Cephalis subspherical with small, subequal, subcircular to elliptical pores; separated from thorax by a change of contour, not a distinct stricture.  Apical horn ascends dorsally in the sagittal plane from the apical bar which is a dorsal rib in the wall of the cephalis; horn long, heavy, three-bladed, latticed proximally.  Vertical horn ascends ventrally in the sagittal plane, extends from the thin, cylindrical vertical bar which is free within the cephalic cavity; horn similar to apical horn, latticed proximally.  Four collar pores present at base of cephalis; ventral arch and apical-lateral arches present as ribs in the wall of the cephalis.  Thorax long, pyramidal with three flat sides each extending between the dorsal and primary lateral thoracic ribs.  Pores of thorax small, equal, hexagonal to subcircular, arranged hexagonally in transverse rows, separated by thin intervening bars.  In one test three continuous transverse ribs present but do not correspond to constrictions of the thorax (Pl. 27, fig. 2).  Dorsal and primary lateral bars of the collar region thin, cylindrical, extend as ribs in the wall of the thorax for most of its length and terminate in heavy, three-bladed, proximally latticed feet which are straight or curve slightly upward and originate at or slightly above the region of maximum breadth of the thorax.  Thin, cylindrical accessory spines (18-31 µm) originate from the thoracic ribs, lie in the plane of the ridge-like ribs, and are joined by a small pored lattice to the ribs; in fully developed tests these spines and attached lattice when joined together resemble a keel originating from the thoracic rib.  Abdomen circular to triangular in section, with pores similar to those of the thorax, not joined to the feet of the test, straight sided thus nearly cylindrical, not constricted distally, with numerous (6-12 or more) straight, thin, conical terminal spines (25-74 µm) originating from its distal margin.  Abdomen separated from thorax by a distinct inward change of contour and in a few tests also by an internal septal ring.

	Measurements; based on 4 specimens from stations 60, 81, and 115: length of cephalis 23-26 µm, of thorax 111-160 µm, of abdomen 49-86 µm; breadth of cephalis 23-27 µm, of thorax (maximum) 149-205 µm, of abdomen (maximum) 144-205 µm; length of apical horn 18-92 µm, of vertical horn 22-92 µm, of feet 31-139 µm.

	Remarks.  This species is nearly identical with Haeckels illustration of Artopilium elegans (Haeckel (1887, Pl. 75, fig. 1) which has four joints, the joint corresponding to the thorax in the Gulf specimens subdivided into a small proximal joint (thorax) and a larger joint (abdomen) similar to the thorax of the Gulf species; therefore, the feet originate from the base of the abdomen in Haeckel's species.  Whether or not the presence of the small proximal joint is subject to intraspecific variation could not be determined from study of the Gulf material because of the very rare occurrence of this species in the Gulf.  In all other aspects the Gulf species is identical. to Artopilium elegans Haeckel

	Distribution.  This species is very rare in the Gulf.  It is present at stations 34, 64, 81, 91, 93, 95, 115, 133, and 151.  Except station 64, these stations are located in the axial region of the Gulf; therefore, this species has affinity for offshore, more nearly oceanic waters.
	Haeckel (1887, p. 1440) reported Artopilium elegans from the central Pacific at "Challenger" station 274.  Species similar to this species or the Gulf species have not been reported elsewhere.

Pterocanium praetextum (Ehrenberg)

Lychnocanium praetextum Ehrenberg, 1872a, Akad. Berlin Monatsb. (1872), p. 316; 1872b, Akad. Berlin Abhandl. (1872), Pl. 10, fig. 2.
Pterocanium praetextum (Ehrenberg), Haeckel, 1887, Challenger Rept., Zool., vol. 18, pp. 1330-1331; Riedel, 1957, Swed. Deep-Sea Exped. Repts., vol. 6, fasc. 3, pp. 86-87, Pl. 3, figs. 1-3.
Pterocanium virgineum Haeckel, 1887, Challenger Rept., Zool., vol. 18 p. 1330, Pl. 73, fig. 6.

Remarks.  This species does not differ appreciably from its description by Riedel (1957, pp. 86-87).  The pores of the cephalis are not generally infilled but are small.  The thoracic pores are more nearly equal with regular arrangement in longitudinal rows, but several specimens have less regular pores similar to those illustrated by Riedel (op. cit., Pl. 3, figs. 1-3). The feet of the Gulf specimens show a wider range of variation than indicated by Riedel. Although they are predominantly subparallel, in a few specimens they are straight but divergent outward.
	This species differs from P. prosperinae Ehrenberg from the Gulf in the presence of three swellings or angular shoulders of the thorax that are each located between the indistinct thoracic ribs which occupy slight furrows in the thoracic wall.  The cephalis of P. praetextum is separated from the thorax by a more distinct stricture, each blade of the three-bladed feet is latticed for a greater distance in its proximal portion, and the outward projecting blade of each foot originates from higher up on the thorax and is convex outward proximally, merging with the outline of the thorax.  Four small, nearly circular collar pores separated by thick bars present a different aspect from those of the preceding species.  The abdomen is similar to that of Pterocanium prosperinae and is separated from the thorax by a distinct constriction and an internal septal ring.

	Measurements; based on 15 specimens from stations 27, 34, 46, 56, and 60: length of cephalis 17-25 µm, of thorax 49-59 µm, of abdomen 0-31 µm; breadth of cephalis 18-27 µm, of thorax at level of shoulders 79-92 µm; length of apical horn 31-53 µm, of vertical spine 4-10 µm, of feet 49-166 µm; maximum distance between tips of feet 49-166 µm.

	Distribution.  This species is very rare in the Gulf, occurring only in the southern half of the Gulf at stations 27, 34, 46, 56, 60, 64, 81, 92, 93, and 95.  It is, therefore, an oceanic species with little affinity for Gulf waters.
	According to Riedel (1957, p. 87), P. praetextum occurs in the upper parts of most Pacific and Indian Ocean sediment cores from tropical regions and is apparently widespread in Recent tropical seas.  Its earliest known occurrence is probably upper Pliocene because it occurs together with P. prismatium Riedel in the upper Pliocene parts of Swedish Deep-Sea Expedition cores 58 and 62.  Riedel (op. cit., p. 88) states that P. prismatium may be an indicator of a time-zone near the top of the Tertiary.  Riedel, Bramlette, and Parker (1963, p. 1238) state that both P.  prismatium and Eucyrtidium elongatum peregrinum became extinct at approximately the same time at the end of the Pliocene, although the former may extend a little later in time than was previously thought.

	Single, smooth, spherical to ellipsoidal shell with 4-20 or more unbranched hyaline tubules arising from the shell surface and without regular arrangement.  Shell with scattered, small, unequal, subcircular to subelliptical pores (2-6 µm in diameter) separated by wide intervening bars; 8-14 pores on half the circumference.  Tubules of variable length, cylindrical with generally smooth rims, but in specimens with very long tubules the rims are surmounted by 2-3 short toothlike spines.

	Measurements: based on 11 specimens from stations 27, 34, 46, 56,and 60: diameter of shell 87-108 µm, length of tubules 4-21 µm.

	Remarks. This species differs from Haeckel's description and illustration of Siphonosphaera socialis (1887,  p. 106, Pl. 6, Figs. 1, 2) in having more than four cylindrical tubules, smaller, less regular pores of the latticed shell and a much larger shell diameter.  The diameter of the shell and the number of tubules of S. macrosiphonia Haeckel (1887, p. 107) agree with the Gulf specimens, but Haeckel describes its pores as being of equal size and distribution.  Without an illustration of this species identification of the Gulf species with it is tentative only.  It does occur in the central tropical Pacific whereas S. socialis was reported from the tropical and subtropical eastern Atlantic.  Haeckel's illustration of S. serpula Haeckel (1887, p. 107, Pl. 6, fig. 6) is in nearly perfect agreement with the Gulf species, including shell diameter, but the tubules are contorted whereas those of the Gulf specimens are not.  It is possible that the tubules of the latter are incomplete but if complete may show contortions.  Siphonosphaera tubulosa Müller, according to Haeckel (1887. p. 105), has hyaline tubules but also a hyaline shell, although Brandt's illustration of a form he identified as S. tubulosa (Brandt, 1885, Pl. 7, fig. 33) has a shell with small scattered pores.  S. tenera Brandt (1885, pp. 266-268) is described as having very short tubules but slit-like pores on the remainder of the shell (op. cit., Pl. 7, figs. 38, 39, 48).  Positive identification of the Gulf species of Siphonosphaera is not possible mainly because its rare occurrence in the Gulf prohibits an adequate analysis of its intraspecific variation.
 
	

	Distribution: Species of the genus Siphonosphaera have been reported from tropical or subtropical regions of all seas as well as from the Mediterranean Sea.  In the absence of further knowledge this species appears to be a tropical oceanic form.  In the Gulf it is very rare, occurring only at the southern Gulf stations 27, 34, 46, 56, 60, and 95.  It is apparently not influenced by upwelling.

Spongaster tetras Ehrenberg

Spongaster tetras Ehrenberg, 1861, Akad. Berlin Monatsb. (1861), p. 301; 1873b, Akad. Berlin, Abhandl. (1872), P1. 6 (3), fig. 8. 

	Test similar to that of Dictyocoryne cf. truncatum except four, equally disposed, spongy arms, instead of three, arise from the circular central region; with complete or partially developed spongy patagium.  Most tests with square outline having rounded corners, a few tests trapezoidal in outline.  The internal structure of the central region consisting of 8-10 or more concentric, latticed discoidal shells; arms appear to be spongy, without concentric rings or shells, generally of equal size, without definite margins.  No specimens observed without a patagium or portion thereof.

	Measurements; based on 30 specimens from stations 46, 56, 60, 71, and 81: diameter of central region (dark spot) 49-111 µm; length of diagonals of test (includes opposite pairs of arms) 127-296 µm.

	Distribution.  This species is rare at all Gulf stations where it is present.  It occurs as far north as station 192.  It is absent at stations 90, 115, 133, 136, 151, 191, 194, and all those to the north.  Because it is present at only four stations in the northern half of the Gulf, its greater affinity for oceanic water masses is indicated.
	Ehrenberg reported Spongaster tetras from the Pacific Ocean near California.  Haeckel (1887, p. 597) later reported it as cosmopolitan, occurring at the surface and at various depths in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans.  It has not been reported from high latitudes.

Spongodiscus biconcavus (Haeckel) Popofsky

Spongodiscus biconcavus H., Popofsky, 1912, Deutsche Südpolar-Exped., vol. 13, p. 143, P1. 6, fig. 2.

	Test a spongy disc, thickened in the center and around the margin, with a definite V-shaped notch in the margin.  Center of test appears dark, consists of 8-10 concentric discoidal shells which, however, appear spongy in surface view; remainder of test of a dense spongy structure (text-fig. 14).  One specimen observed with about 20 marginal spines, 18-25 µm in length.

	Measurements; based on 30 specimens from stations 27, 46, 60, 64, and 81: diameter of disc 221-400 µm, of central dark area 58-l35 µm.

	Remarks. Haeckel (l887, p. 577) originally defined but did not illustrate this species.  Popofsky identified a species which is the same as the Gulf species in all details as Spongodiscus biconcavus Haeckel.  Haeckel did not discuss the notch in the margin of the disc, but Popofsky's illustration shows it; therefore, some doubt exists whether this species is S. biconcavus in the sense of Haeckel, but it is the same as Popofsky's interpretation of the species.

	Distribution.  This species is cosmopolitan in the Gulf, being absent only at stations 203 and 214.  It is rare at all other stations except at 64 and 184 where it is common.  Its distribution in part may be controlled by upwelling because it occurs in slightly greater numbers in some areas of upwelling, namely at stations 64, 92, and 99.  Its greatest frequency is at station 184 (3.4%); therefore, its distribution is similar to that of other species that show increases at this station as well as at 194.  This may reflect its tolerance of higher than average salinity and temperature in this region.
	Popofsky (1912, p. 143) reported this species at a depth of 400 meters from three stations in the equatorial Atlantic.  Haeckel (1887, p. 577) reported his species from "Challenger" station 265 in the tropical central Pacific.  It has not been reported from high latitudes; therefore, it may be confined to tropical parts of the world's oceans.

<de_description><![CDATA[Benson, 1966, p. 215-217; pl. 11, figs. 2-3; text-fig.15 

Spongopyle osculosa Dreyer 

Spongopyle osculosa Dreyer, 1889, Jenaische Zeitschr. Naturwiss., vol. 23, pp. 118-119, P1. 11, figs. 99, 100; Riedel, 1958, B.A.N.Z.A.R.E. Repts., ser. B, vol. 6, pt. 10, pp. 226-227, Pl. 1, fig. 12. 

Test circular in outline, spongy appearing, with a latticed tubular pylome, generally circular in section, arising from within the test but not from its central darker area and in most specimens extending beyond the margin as a distinct tube whose rim is surmounted by a few short triangular teeth. In side view tests either flat or with broad, convex outward curvature, with margin rounded to trapezoidal in outline; internal structure of test not spongy but consisting of numerous (8-10 or more), closely and equally spaced, concentric, discoidal shells (text-fig. 15), with outer shell somewhat thickened in a few tests giving the appearance of a sieve-plate covering the spongy- 
appearing, internal part of the test. Structure of tubular pylome consisting of a small-pored lattice developed between 5-6 parallel beams or spines that are arranged around a circle. 

Measurements; based on 30 specimens from stations 27, 34, 46, and 81: diameter of disc 121-289 µm; length of tubular pylome including its visible portion within the test 18-68 µm; breadth of pylome 10-25 µm. 

Remarks. There is no doubt that this species is the same as Spongopyle osculosa described by Dreyer (1889) and Riedel (1958). Those authors did not describe the internal concentric shell structure of the test, but in surface view the specimens appear spongy. The only differences between S. osculosa Dreyer and S. setosa Dreyer (1889, p. 119, P1. 11, figs. 97, 98) is that the latter has weakly developed peripheral spines and has a smaller disc diameter; whether or not it is an incompletely developed form of S. osculosa cannot be determined without reference to Dreyer's type material. 

Distribution. This species is rare but cosmopolitan in the Gulf, occurring as far north as station 208. It is absent at stations 91, 130, 184, 191, 194, 203, 206, and 214. Its frequency undergoes no significant changes from station to station; therefore, the control of its distribution by upwelling cannot be assessed. It has a slightly greater average frequency in the southern half of the Gulf, indicating its preference for oceanic waters. 
Riedel (1958, p. 227) states that this species may be cosmopolitan because it was reported from Antarctic sediments as well as from the southern Indian Ocean and the tropical and northern Pacific Ocean.

Nat. d'Hist. Natur., Archives, vol. 7, ser. 7, pp. 97-98, P1. 20, figs. 5-7, P1. L45, fig. 4.

	Test consisting of two small, concentric, latticed shells with 6-15 long, heavy, subregularly arranged, three-bladed radial spines with several verticils of lateral branches.  A spherical to ellipsoidal, loose, spongy meshwork without definite outward termination is developed between the lateral branches and the surface of the outer shell.  Inner latticed shell polyhedral (octahedral or cubic) with 3-4  large, subpolygonal pores on the half circumference.  Second shell subspherical, globular or suboctahedral with 7-10 subequal, subregularly arranged, subpolygonal pores on the half circumference.  Radial spines originate as thin cylindrical beams from the surface of the inner shell, become heavier and three-bladed where they emerge as spines from the second shell; between the second shell and the periphery of the spongy meshwork the spines are either relatively narrow or increase gradually in breadth distally (4-7 µm), but beyond the spongy meshwork they increase greatly in breadth (10-37 µm) but retain this same breadth, gradually tapering to a point, distally.  Edges of each of the three-blades serrated beyond the spongy sphere but with conical spines arising at numerous verticils within the mass of the spongy sphere.

	Measurements; based on 19 specimens from stations 93, 151, 133, and 191: diameter of outer spongy sphere 129-486 µm, of second shell 34-47 µm, of inner shell 15-26 µm; length of radial spines measured from periphery of spongy sphere 135-1120 µm.

	Distribution.  This species is nearly cosmopolitan in the Gulf.  It has a slightly higher average frequency in the northern half of the Gulf than in the southern half.  In the latter region it is very rare and is absent at stations 27, 56, and 90.  Its highest frequency (1.0%) in this region is at station 64 which is located within a region of upwelling near the Mexican mainland.  In the northern Gulf it is present only at stations located within or near the diatomite facies.  It is absent at stations 130, 194, 203, 206, and 214 and is rare at all other stations except 191 where it is common (2.0%).  Its distribution in this part of the Gulf is therefore influenced in part if not wholly by upwelling.
	Haeckel (1887, p. 282) states that this species is common in all warmer seas at the surface.  Hollande and Enjumet (1960, p. 98) state that it is one of the most common species in the plankton in the Bay of Algiers and that it ranges in depth from the surface to 1000 meters.

<de_description><![CDATA[Spongy skeleton in form of biconvex lens. Its structure examined in detail by Riedel: inner disk of dense spongy tissue encircled above and below by finer and looser spongy tissue. Surface of shell in adult specimens covered by porous simple mantle. Formation of a mantel in skeletons possessing spongy structure (in our material in Spongurus pylomaticus, Spongodiscus (?) osculosus, and Spongotrochus glacialis) is the result of the growth of spongy tissue, i.e. it signifies the growth of the skeleton. In these species the mantel is very thin, somewhat differentiated in its structure from the basic spongy tissue. Usually mantel developed only in central part, absent near margins, impression created that shell is covered by two caps or hoods. Mantle fused to main spongy tissue of disk.  

Numerous radial needle of various length and thickness. Needles faceted and expanded at base, extending fairly deeply into shell in form of radial pieces. These pieces laid down at the same time as the basic spongy tissue, constantly growing thicker with the growth of shell. Radial needles extending outside both around equator of shell and along entire surface. Strongest needles about 12 in number, distributed on margin of disk, not less than five stout needles are on each flattened side of shell. Space of spongy tissue observed on surface of disk as pores, of approximately same size as in Spongodiscus (?) setosus. Pores on mantle more regular and smaller. In adult large specimens marked pylome usually present, in form of funnel in spongy tissue, running through radius to center. Presence of pylome not remarked by Riedel; actually, it is noted in less than one-third of all specimens encountered.

Dimensions: diameter of disk (in adult specimens with mantle) 270-500 micrometer, diameter of spaces at margin of disk 8-12 micrometer, in center of disk about 5 micrometer, diameter of pores on porous plates of mantle 2-5 micrometer. Needles usually broken off more or less near to base, but even needles known to be incomplete are up to 200 micrometer long, thickness of needle at base up to 30 micrometer.

<de_description><![CDATA[Eucyrtidium seriatum Jörg. in Gran L. 70, p. 150 (nomen nudum).

Stichocorys seriata:
A many-jointed form. The uppermost joints are convex and increase in size so that the diameter of the fifth is from three to four times as great as that of the first. The lower part is more or less distinctly cylindrical. On the cephalis, there is a short broad tophorn. The pores below are roundish rectangular, in very distinct, regular, horizontal rows.
	
The number of the joints varies, probably according to age. Uppermost there is a low, semispherical (or broader) cephalis, then short joints, which increase evenly in width up to the fourth or fifth, which is usually the broadest. From the sixth joint, which is decidedly narrower, the width decreases, but very slowly, so that the lower part is almost cylindrical, only a little narrower below. I have not seen more than eight joints. These lower joints in the cylindrical part are not plainly divided off from each other.
	
The upper part of the shell is shaped like a high cone. There is a short, broad, three-edged (?) tophorn protruding from an inner skeleton in the two upper joints.
	
It is not easy to see these inner skeleton parts which are, at all events, in a high degree retrograded, for it is a difficult matter to examine the shell from the open end, and the outer lattice shell in side view hides the short, primary spines. So I have not been able definitely to decide whether this genus has the same primary skeleton parts as the foregoing ones. Neither have I been sure if protruding basal spines exist in the two upper joints (the apical spine only excepted).
	
The shape of the cephalis in some positions of the lattice shell might suggest that also inner primary arches are to be found, and not only the primary spines.
	
It is doubtful whether there is a protruding ventral, sagittal spine.
	
On the other hand, a long, inner axial spine is plainly visible. It seems to consist of three or more long, parallel branches, which reach down through more than half the length of the lattice shell.
	
The central capsule also reaches far down through the shell.
	
The pores on the cephalis are small, round, widely apart and scattered. On the second joint, they are perhaps a little larger, on the third somewhat smaller again, and from here they are regularly placed in horizontal rows. From the fourth joint and downwards, the pores become more irregular in form and size, from quite small and round to rather large, roundish rectangular in shape, although generally speaking they are small and always in regular, horizontal rows. On the cylindrical lower part, they are also placed in more irregular vertical rows. The average size of the pores does not increase, at any rate noticeably, from the fourth joint downwards.
	
This species varies rather considerably. For instance, its greatest width may be either in the fourth or fifth joint, and there are often irregular contractions in the lower part. It is doubtful whether any of the individuals illustrated are fully developed. On the best developed specimen (Jørgensen 1905, fig. 102) the lower margin was regularly dentate. Often young individuals may be found consisting of only a few joints and entirely without the cylindrical lower part.
	
Height, up to 128µ, greatest width 72µ. Pores, up to 6µ.
	
The species resembles the one illustrated by Cleve (1899, pl. 2, figs. 5-6), which he calls Lithomitra australis EHRB. It is probable that the same basal spines are present in this species, protruding as fine needles, as in Androcyclas gamphonycha and Clathrocyclas craspedota. Even if these spines are present, Haeckels name for the genus might in this case be retained without any great disadvantage.
	
Rather rare, always in small numbers and only in deep water samples.
	
Distribution: In surface samples, 2/2 1901, off Søndmøre, 13/2 off Lofoten and 5/3 off Finmark. Most probably a boreal oceanic species.]]></de_description>

Stichopilium bicorne Haeckel

Stichopilium bicorne Haeckel, 1887, Challenger Rept., Zool., vol. 18, p. 1437, Pl. 77, fig. 9.

	Cephalis smooth, cap-shaped, separated from thorax by a change in contour, but in most specimens the apical-lateral arches and the ventral arch are represented by ribs which occupy slight furrows separating the cephalis from small, dorsal and ventral lobate swellings of the proximal portion of the thorax; pores of cephalis small, equal, subcircular to polygonal, regularly arranged.  Two prominent, straight, nearly equal, three-bladed cephalic horns lying in the sagittal plane correspond to the dorsally ascending apical horn and ventrally ascending vertical horn.  The former extends from the apical bar which in its upper portion above the junction with the apical-lateral arches is a dorsal rib in the wall of the cephalis and in its lower portion is free within the cephalic cavity.  The latter horn extends from and is collinear with the vertical bar which joins with the ventral arch.  The dorsal and primary lateral bars extend as ribs in the thoracic wall and are prolonged into heavy, equal, three-bladed, wing-like spines which are generally straight and diverge downward but are nearly horizontal in a few specimens; spines latticed proximally in a few tests.  Thorax pyramidal with slightly concave sides between the thoracic ribs in its proximal portion; its distal portion circular in section, campanulate or inflated cylindrical; the wall of the thorax is extended outward where each of the three basal spines originate, thus giving the appearance of three latticed wings originating from the middle portion of the thorax.  Number of abdominal segments variable from none to at least two; these joints separated from one another and the thorax by distinct constrictions which are generally occupied by continuous internal septal rings.  Abdominal joints cylindrical, inflated, truncate conical or campanulate.  Surface of thorax and abdominal joints smooth.  Pores of these joints similar, of equal size, small, hexagonal to subcircular, hexagonally arranged in transverse rows.

	Measurements; based on 10 specimens from stations 27, 34, 46, 60, and 64: length of test 98-193 µm, maximum breadth (thoracic or abdominal joints) 80-138 µm; length of cephalis 21-25 µm, of thorax 62-102 µm, of first abdominal joint 25-49 µm; breadth of cephalis 20-31 µm, of thorax (distal portion) 83-111 µm; length of apical horn 14-49 µm, of vertical horn 15-37 µm, of basal spines 12-53 µm. 

	Remarks.  There is no doubt that the Gulf species is identical with Stichopilium bicorne Haeckel.  Campbell (1954, p. D136) states that Stichopilium Haeckel (1882, p. 439) is an objective synonym of Triacartus Haeckel (1882, p.  437) and that the type species of the latter is Stichopilium cortina Haeckel (1887, p. 1437), an unfigured species.  Earlier, however, Frizzell and Middour (1951) designated S. bicorne  as the type species of Stichopilium.  I agree with the latter designation as well as with Haeckel's (1887, p. 1436) first revision in which Triacartus is placed in synonymy with Stichopilium, the former becoming a subgenus under the latter.

	Distribution.  This species is cosmopolitan but very rare in the Gulf.  It is absent at stations 90, 95, 99, 130, 191, 194, and all those to the north.  Its absence at most of the marginal localities indicates its preference for more nearly oceanic offshore waters.  Its very rare occurrence indicates that it does not respond significantly to upwelling in the Gulf.
	Haeckel (1887, p. 1437) reported this species from the central Pacific at "Challenger" station 271.  Its absence at high latitudes indicates that it is a tropical species.

<de_description><![CDATA[Streblacantha circumtexta:
This is also a very difficult form to define, and I have not yet succeeded in getting a clear insight into its structure. It can, however, not belong to the genus Sorolarcus HCK., as I at first thought. 

There appear to be about 12 strong radial spine, of the same shape as those of Phorticium pylonium CL., but protruding much further. They are more or less round, not three edged. 

The outline of the shell in most positions is a broad oval, in a few, almost round. Some optical sections show inner spirals, then a double spiral as in Larcospira minor, other sections show at least 3 shells one outside the other; perhaps with several chambers (only, indistinctly seen). 

On the smaller and simpler forms (cfr. Pl. XI, f. 46, c, d; pl. XII, fi. 46 k, l), which I have taken to be specimens in an early stage of development, a single central chamber and spiral twists, which appear to form a snail spiral, may be seen. 

On the whole it seems to me at present, that this species may best be placed in the genus Streblacantha HCK., though it may prove not to belong to this genus either. 

The outer shell shows a more or less irregular structure and very uneven pores, from rather small to large ones and large holes. On the outside of larger (more developed) forms there are also more or less well developed byspines, very various as regards length and development, from small subulate ones with a rather wide base, to long, narrow needles. When more developed, these byspines are more or less connected through fine branches to an outer, spongy case immediately outside the outer shell. This spongy case is, however, rarely much developed, and seems then to be confined to  or at any rate most developed at  the one end of the shell. Cfr. Also Jörgensen (1900).

Rare, and generally only singly, the small, younger individuals rather more frequent: The Vest Fiord I, 13/1, 0-180m; Henningsvær, 17/1, 0-180m; the sea off Gaukværö, 19/1, 0-700m; Skroven, 1/2, 0-300m; 4/2, 350-300m; 4/4, 0-150m; The Raftsund, 3/2, 0-260m; The Tys Fiord I, 28/3, 0-700m. ]]></de_description>

<de_description><![CDATA[Benson, 1966, p. 182-183; pl. 7, figs. 12-13:

Xiphatractus cronos (Haeckel)

Amphisphaera cronos Haeckel, 1887, Challenger Rept., Zool., vol. 18, p.144, P1. 17, fig 5.

	Test consisting of three ellipsoidal shells with two unequal, three-bladed to conical polar spines which continue inward to the second shell as heavy three-bladed radial beams and to the first shell as thinner beams.  The shells are joined by numerous thin beams which arise at the nodes of the intervening bars of both the first and second shells; some beams continuous from first shell to third, some from first to second, others only from second to third.  Polar spines generally three-bladed, of variable length and breadth, in nearly all specimens of unequal size; no accessory radial spines present.  Outer shell generally ellipsoidal, in a few tests spherical, generally with thorns at the nodes of the intervening bars, in a few tests with smooth surface; with large, equal, subcircular to polygonal pores, hexagonally arranged, 6-9 on half the minor circumference, generally with polygonal frames.  Second shell ellipsoidal, with subequal, polygonal to subpolygonal, hexagonally arranged pores, 6-8 on half the minor circumference, with polygonal frames.  Inner shell ellipsoidal, with subregularly arranged, subequal polygonal pores, 6-8 on half the minor circumference.	

	Measurements; based on 30 specimens from stations 27, 34, and 46: major dianeter of outer shell 107-139 µm, of second shell 62- 84 µm, of inner shell 31-46 µm; minor diameter of outer shell 90-123 µm, of second shell 57-79 µm; length of greater polar spine 15-96 µm, of lesser polar spine 2-85 µm; breadth of base of spines 7-25 µm. 

	Remarks.  This species differs from Xiphatractus pluto in the thinner wall of the cortical shell (3-5 :m), the lack of small, circular, secondary pores filling the spaces of the larger pores of the cortical shell, and in generally less robust polar spines.  Haeckel describes Amphisphaera cronos Haeckel as having a smooth, spherical, cortical shell, but a few specimens from the Gulf also were observed with smooth, spherical, cortical shells, although the majority have ellipsoidal thorny shells.  The dimensions he gives are in agreement with those of the Gulf specimens.

	Distribution.  This species occurs rarely only in the southern half of the Gulf at stations 27, 34, 46, 56, 60, 64, 71, 90, 91, 93, and 95.  It is absent at all other stations.  Its highest frequency was observed at station 90, but this may be the result of fewer species present at this station rather than of upwelling.  It is, therefore, a rare member of the tropical Pacific fauna and is not tolerant of water masses with higher salinity and temperature.
	Haeckel (1887, p 1L~4) reported this species from Challenger station 330 in the southern Atlantic.  Since the taxonomy of this species is not well-known, its worldwide distribution cannot be assessed.  Several of Haeckel's species are similar to this and Xiphatractus pluto.  Further taxonomic study of this species-group is needed.

Xiphatractus pluto(Haeckel)

Amphisphaera pluto Haeckel, 1887, Challenger Rept , Zool , vol. 18, p 144, P1 17, figs 7, 8.
Xiphatractus stahli Dreyer?, 1889, Jenaische Zeitschr. Naturwiss., vol 23, pp 129-130, Pl. 6, fig. 17.
Stylatractus neptunus Haeckel?, Riedel, 1958, B.A.N.Z.A.R.E. Repts., ser. B, vol 6, pt 10, p 226, P1. 1, fig 9.

	Test consisting of three ellipsoidal shells with two unequal polar spines.  Basic structure of test similar to that of Xiphatractus cronos.  Major difference between this species and Xiphatractus cronos is in the details of the cortical shell and polar spines.  Cortical shell with very thick wall (10-12  µm), ellipsoidal in all specimens, with large, subequal, subcircular, hexagonally arranged pores, 7-8 on half the minor circumference; openings of all pores filled with 2-4 or more subcircular to irregular, subequal pores, in many specimens not completely developed, giving the primary pores a scalloped appearance.  Polar spines absent in a few specimens, represented by short, triangular thorns in others, in most specimens robust, long, conical, in some specimens grooved at their bases, three-bladed in a few, always unequal.  Inner shells generally difficult to observe but not unlike those of the preceding species.

Measurements; based on 30 specimens from stations 27, 34, and 46: major diameter of outer shell 108-199 µm, of second shell 63-86 µm, of first shell 27-43 µm; minor diameter of outer shell 92-160 µm, of second shell 53-80 µm, of first shell 22-31 µm; length of greater polar spine (when present) 5-117 µm, of lesser polar spine (when present) 2-98 µm; breadth at base of spines 10-34 µm.

	Remarks.  This species agrees best with Riedel's description and illustration (1958, p. 226, P1. 1, fig. 9) of a species he described from the Antarctic but identified tentatively with Stylatractus neptunus Haeckel (1887, p. 328, P1. 17, fig. 6).  The pores of the cortical shell of the Gulf specimens are unlike those of S. neptunus Haeckel, but agree with those of Amphisphaera pluto Haeckel (1887, p. 144, P1. 17, figs. 7, 8) in that the larger pores are more or less scalloped.  In fully developed specimens from the Gulf the large pores are filled with 2-4 or more secondary pores, and if these pores are incompletely developed, the large pores appear as in A. pluto, i.e., scalloped.  Xiphatractus stahli Dreyer (1889, p. 129, P1. 6, fig. 17) agrees with the Gulf specimens in all details, particularly in the details of the polar spines, but Dreyer did not mention the presence of large, equal, cortical shell pores but does state that the small circular pores of this shell appear to be arranged in groups of 2-5.  This could be explained if they represent secondary pores filling the spaces of the larger primary pores.  The dimension of all three species mentioned above are in agreement with those of the Gulf species.

	Distribution.  The distribution of this species in the Gulf is similar to that of Xiphatractus cronos although it is less frequent.  It occurs rarely only at stations 27, 34, 46, 56, 60, 71, 81, and 95.  Thus it is a more nearly oceanic species not tolerant of waters with higher salinity and temperature.  It does not appear to be controlled by upwelling.
	Riedel (1958, p. 226) states that specimens closely resembling the Antarctic forms of this species have been found in the northern Pacific and in the tropical parts of the Pacific and Indian Oceans.  Haeckel (1887, p. 144) reported Amphisphaera pluto from the central Pacific.  Dreyer (1889, p. 130) reported Xiphatractus stahli from the same region.  It appears that the Gulf species has a cosmopolitan distribution.

<de_description><![CDATA[Stylodictya aculeata: 
This species corresponds well in structure to the foregoing one [Stylodictya validispina], but differs in a marked degree with regard to its radial spines, which are particularly numerous, and are more irregularly placed, not all lying at the same level, that of the disc, but pointing obliquely beyond and beneath it.

Shape of the shell in side view: Broadly linear, with rounded corners and ends. From the centre to near the margin, there are small scattered punctiform byspines.

System of rings: On the whole like the preceding, only the rings are more irregular in shape and width. Outside the fourth ring there seems to be traceable the beginning of a 5th which is as yet not formed.

Pores: On the whole like those of the preceding. Very large pores here and there on the edge of the disc, which would probably have formed several smaller ones later on. The byspines are very scattered, fewer in number than in the preceding species, but distributed over a larger part of the disc.

Radial spines: The rings are united similarly to those in the preceding species, but the number of radial spines around the disc is larger, more than 30. The spines are narrower and more irregularly developed, some being a little bent, turned outwards and obliquely upwards, not all at the same level, equatorial, but distributed over the broad, rounded margin of the disc. The length of the spines is about the same as in the preceding species.

Byspines: Very similar to those of the preceding species, but more scattered and distributed over the whole of the disc nearly out to the margin.

Dimensions: The diameter of the inmost shell 12µm, of the first ring about 38µm, of the second 54µm, of the third 85µm, of the fourth 110µm. Pores uneven, most of them being 2-4µm. The spines protrude as much as to 30µm. The disc is 28µm in thickness.

This form appears to differ considerably from the other species on account of the irregularly placed marginal spines. The specimen illustrated is probably not quite fully developed.]]></de_description>

<de_description><![CDATA[Stylodictya tenuispina:
Shape of the shell in side view: Almost linear, though somewhat thicker in the middle and slightly narrowed towards the ends which are rounded off. A small portion of central part of the shell is strongly convex, forming a protruding ball shaped cap on either side. 

System of Rings: From an inner little spherical shell 4 radial rods extend in the form of a cross to the 1st ring, which forms an irregular quadrangle with rounded corners. The radial rods pass through the middle of the sides. Beyond this ring there are, on the specimen illustrated, 6-7 rings, each joined to the one next outside by a continually increasing number of radial rods. It is likely that the number of the rings increases as time goes on. The inner rings are still somewhat angular, the outer, however, more regular. The outmost ones seem, however, again to show irregularity, which perhaps, disappears with age.

Pores: The strongly convex central part, which corresponds fairly well to the 1st ring, has unusually large, roundish, hexagonal pores, which are much broader than the separating walls. The rest of the pores are exceptionally small and uneven in size, most of them being narrower than the intermediate spaces, or of the same width as these, very little larger outwards, 2-3 on the space between two rings.

Radial spines: Around the disc a few very narrow, needle-shaped radial spines protrude, apparently in no definite order. Numerous radial rods are to be found between the outer rings; some go through two or more, others again only connecting two rings.

Byspines: Very small, almost punctiform, short byspines, largest and closest together on the convex central part, the others being only scattered over the disc.

Dimensions: Diameter of 1st ring 30&#956;m, of 2nd 42&#956;m, of 3rd 59&#956;m, of 4th 78&#956;m, of 5th 98&#956;m, of 6th 120&#956;m, of 7th 144&#956;m, 8th ring irregular and as yet incomplete. The rings are thus somewhat broader ontwards. The large pores on the central part 5-6&#956;m, the small ones only 1.5-3-4&#956;m. The few piercing radial spines only protrude as far as a distance equal to the breadth of the rings. The disc is 37&#956;m thick at the convex central part, outside this 30&#956;m, only about half as thick at the margin. 

The specimen which is illustrated (Jørgensen, 1905) seems to me to suggest that the few piercing radial spines are in reality radial rods which penetrate several rings, similarly to those which are seen here and there farther in between the rings. In this case, it is hardly correct to consider them as the radial spines characteristic of the genus Stylodictya. The above species might just as well, for that matter, be classed as belonging to the genus Porodiscus (without marginal spines); but as one cannot be sure whether there may not be radial spines on the outside ring in the fully developed individual, I have retained the species under the genus Stylodictya, where it would at once be placed after a less critical examination. It is certainly also closely related to the following species. 

In structure it is very like Porodiscus orbiculatus HCK, which, however, wants the very characteristic, coarsely porous, central part. This has the appearance of a spherical shell with a diameter greater than the breadth of the disc, with a smaller sphere in the middle (this sphere is the innermost shell) and with equatorial rings outside. 

Only twice noticed in 1899: In the sea off Gaukværö, 19/1, 0-700 m; in the sea off Röst, 22/3, 0-900 m. This makes it very probable that it is an oceanic, deep water species, which only exceptionally comes to our coasts.]]></de_description>

<de_description><![CDATA[Stylodictya validispina:
The structure is, on the whole, the same as in the foregoing species. The strange, peculiar, strongly convex central part is, however, wanting (the disc is homogeneous) and the margin is furnished with numerous strong spines which are almost regularly distributed.

Shape of the shell in side view: Broadly linear (the disc is of almost even thickness) but little narrower at the margin that in the middle, with sharp or obtuse corners, not clearly rounded off at the ends, but almost square. There are short spines scattered on the central part.

The system of rings: From the innermost little shell 4 radial rods extend in the shape of a cross to the first ring, as in the preceding species. The ring itself is also here an irregular quadrangle with rounded corners. Outside this ring, there are three others, connected to each other by radial rods whose number increases outwards. In the prolongation of the 4 primary radial rods (from the inmost shell) May be seen, more or less clearly, some similar ones which are rather crookedly placed, and these conjoin to form 4, more or less definite, zigzag rods, which go through the whole system of rings. On the outside ring there are numerous (21) equatorial, narrowly conical, marginal spines.

Pores: The pores in the centre are very small, punctiform, very scattered with wide intermediate spaces, gradually larger outwards, on the two outer rings about 2 on the space between the rings, uneven in size, up to 4µm or a little larger. Between the pores on the central part very small, punctiform byspines are scattered, which may easily be overlooked.

Radial spines: Numerous, narrowly conical (subulate), Strong radial spines of different lengths, the longest being little more than 1/2 of the radius of the disc. Some project out from the ring next to the outside one, several too from the one next to the inmost one, and yet a few from the innermost one.

Byspines: A few scattered ones, very short and very small, needle shaped, extend from the central part of the disc.

Dimensions: The diameter of the inner shell 14µm, of the first ring 34µm, of the second 60µm, of the third 84µm, of the fourth 102µm. In thickness 24µm.

The specimen illustrated appears to be almost fully developed. Probably only the small portion of the outer ring which is not seen in the illustration, is all that is wanting. This species exhibits a certain amount of agreement with S. stellata BAIL., which has, however, fewer and broader spines, and also differs in other respects. Only once found: Sea off Röst, 22/3 1899, 0-900 m. (together with the preceding and the following species).

	Complete tests consisting of two well-defined systems of latticed dimensive girdles, with few, if any, radial beams, and a third outer system of poorly-defined girdles supported by numerous short beams of approximately equal length that arise from the nodes of the intervening bars of the latticed girdles of the second system [pl. 16, fig. 1].  Most tests incomplete, consisting either of all or a portion of the second girdle system (transverse and lateral girdles with rudimentary sagittal girdle), but in several tests with some indication of the third girdle system in the form of numerous branched spines or incomplete outer girdles, generally representing the rudimentary, third transverse girdle. Pores of the latticed girdles relatively large, unequal, irregular to subregular in arrangement, generally subcircular to subpolygonal.  Surface of complete specimens irregular, rough or spinose; surface of second girdle system relatively smooth to highly spinose.  Outline of second lateral girdle generally ellipsoidal (major diameter the principal or P axis) but variable from subcircular to subquadrate.  Gates defined by the transverse and lateral girdles of the second system generally elliptical to kidney-shaped, in a few specimens with beams lying in their plane and joining the transverse girdle with the rudimentary second sagittal girdle.  Radial beams absent in many tests but when present generally lie in the axes of the test (P, T, or S), although in a few specimens they extend from the pole of the inner system of girdles at an acute angle with the axis.  Beams arise from the inner ellipsoidal shell or ring but do not penetrate beyond the second girdle system as free spines; number of coaxial beams variable but generally six when present; a few specimens were observed with only one of a pair of opposite polar beams extending through the inner tubular space between gates; rarely more than one beam observed at each pole; tests without beams generally with short polar spines or thorns representing rudimentary beams.  Specimens with eight diagonal spines, each originating from one of the eight edges of the second transverse girdle (Tetrapyle octacantha Müller) rare, with or without polar beams [pl. 15, figs. 8,9].

	Measurements; based on 30 specimens from stations 27, 34, and 71: range in length of diinensive axes of each girdle system (see text-fig. 18): 

Ranges(µm) 
P1 14-18   T1 9-12    S1 5-9
P2 39-65   T2 31-48   S2 15-25
P3 93-194  T3 70-156  S3 55-95
P4 215-246 T4 172-221 S4 121-221


	Remarks.  This species differs from Phorticium pylonium in the absence of numerous radial beams which, when present, occupy only the dimensive axes of the test, and in the presence of an irregular third system of girdles joined to the second system by numerous, short radial beams arising from the surface of the latter.
	The synonymy of this species or species-group is based only on figures of specimens from the literature.  The decision to name this species Tetrapyle octacantha rests not only on the fact that it was the first-named pylonid taxon but also because the eight diagonal spines characteristic of this species as defined by Müller (1858b, p. 33) were observed to be an intraspecific variation in specimens from the Gulf.  The other species listed in the synonymy either are incomplete forms (ontogenetic stages) of this species, represent orientations other than the frontal orientation, or were observed from the Gulf with the outer or third girdle system complete as defined above.
	After study of hundreds of individual pylonid tests I conclude that the species of this family present in the Gulf could all be placed within a single genus characterized by the presence of one or more concentric systems of latticed dimensive girdles with open. gates on the shell surface.  Because the Gulf assemblage is a limited one and type specimens were not examined such a decision at this stage is premature.  Revision of not only the Pyloniidae, but of the superfamily Litheliacea as well, is needed.

	Distribution.  This species is a predominant member of the Gulf assemblage.  It occurs in greatest abundance in the southern part of the Gulf, being abundant at stations 27, 34, 46, 56, 60, and 71 with a maximum of 16.6% at station 34.  It is abundant (10.6%) at station 92, common at all other stations except 130, 151, and 191 where it occurs rarely, and absent at stations 203 and 214.  In contrast to the distribution of Phorticium pylonium which has maxima near the eastern and western shores of the Gulf with a decrease toward the axial part along the section occupied by stations 90-99, this species shows a higher frequency west of the Gulf axis than east of it.  It occurs in much greater numbers in the southern Gulf than does P. pylonium.  At stations located within the diatomite facies, namely stations 106, 115, 133, 151, 191, and 192, it occurs less commonly than at other stations within this general region, in particular, stations 184, 194, and 208 where its percentage ranges from 4.0-9.2 which is comparable to its frequency at some of the stations in the southern and central Gulf.  Its decrease in the diatomite facies may be the result of its dilution by increases in the abundance of certain nasselline species.  In the northern Gulf, notably at stations 184, 194, and 208, it does show a marked increase; thus, its distribution in this region is similar to the increases noted for Dip1op1egma banzare Riedel and Hexacontium enthacanthum Jørgensen.
	Popofsky (1912, p. 151) states that according to Haeckel this species is cosmopolitan, occurring at the surface in the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans.  Its distribution in polar seas is unknown.  Owing to the poorly known taxonomy of this species or species-group, it is difficult to decide from the literature alone the true nature of its distribution.

Theocorys veneris Haeckel

Theocorys veneris Haeckel, 1887, Challenger Rept., Zool., vol. 18, p. 1415, Pl. 69, fig. 5; Popofsky, 1913, Deutsche Südpolar-Exped., vol. 14, p. 399, text fig. 119.

	Relatively small test consisting of a cephalis, thorax, and abdomen.  Cephalis hemispherical, generally smooth but rough in a few tests, with small, subequal, circular pores.  Apical horn eccentric, three-bladed, long but not robust, extends from the apical bar that is a dorsal cephalic rib coincident with a dorsal sagittal furrow in the cephalis.  Vertical spine when present is short, inconspicuous.  Four collar pores present.  Dorsal and primary lateral bars extend as thoracic ribs coincident with slight furrows in the wall of the thorax; in a few tests the ribs extend as and are collinear with short, thin spines (6-12 µm) that originate above the base of the thorax.  Cephalis separated from thorax by a distinct contour change or by a constriction.  Thorax smooth to slightly rough, inflated, truncate-conical to campanulate or irregular, separated from abdomen by a distinct constriction coincident with an internal septal ring.  Abdomen smooth, ranging from inflated cylindrical with its distal portion tapering inward to nearly cylindrical with its proximal portion broader; outline irregular in a few tests.  Terminal margin of abdomen incomplete; distal portion not turned sharply inward, in some tests straight-sided.  Pores of thorax and abdomen similar, ranging from small, circular, equal, hexagonally arranged in longitudinal rows to subequal, with circular to irregular shapes and arranged only approximnately in longitudinal rows.

	Measurements; based on 6 specimens from stations 34 and 81: maximum length of test 91-130 µm; length of cephalis 16-18 µm, of thorax 34-46 µm, of abdomen 31-66 µm; breadth of cephalis 16-25 µm, of thorax 58-63 µm, of abdomen 55-91 µm; length of apical horn 7-31 µm, of vertical spine 2-6 µm.

	Remarks.  Specimens from the Gulf with regular, equal pores and and an inflated cylindrical thorax and abdomen conform to Haeckels illustration of Theocorys veneris Haeckel.  Those with less regular outline and a campanulate thorax and with less regular pores correspond to Popofsky's illustration of the same species.  No specimens from the Gulf have large pores and long, conical horns as in Brandt's (1935, pp. 57-58, Pl. 10, figs. 16, 17) illustrations of T. veneris Haeckel from the upper Eocene.

	Distribution.  This species is cosmopolitan but very rare in the Gulf.  It is absent at stations 64, 90, 91, 99, 130, 184, 194, and all those to the north.  Its absence at marginal stations in the Gulf indicates its preference for offshore, more nearly oceanic waters.  In the northern Gulf it is present only at those stations located within the diatomite facies.  Although very rare at these stations, its distribution in this region of the Gulf may be influenced by upwelling.  It apparently does not respond to upwelling in the southern half of the Gulf.
	Haeckel (1887, p. 1415) states that this species is cosmopolitan, occurring at the surface at many of the "Challenger" stations in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans.  Haeckel does not state the latitudinal range of this species, but it may be confined to low latitudes.

Theopilium tricostatum Haeckel

Theopilium tricostatum Haeckel, 1887, Challenger Rept., Zool., vol. 18, p. 1322, Pl. 70, fig. 6; Popofsky, 1913, Deutsche Südpolar- Exped., vol. 14, pp. 375-376, Pl. 37, fig. 6.

	Test smooth, consisting of a small subhemispherical cephalis, a campanulate thorax, and a relatively flat, broad, brim-like abdomen.  Cephalis smooth, with small circular pores as broad as the intervening bars, with a dorsal sagittal constriction occupied by the apical bar which extends nearly vertically as an eccentric, relatively thin, conical to three-bladed apical spine, in a few tests classifiable as a horn; vertical spine extends from the vertical bar and is generally thin, conical, of variable length. Thorax divided from cephalis by a slight stricture occupied by the collar ring; campanulate, with hexagonally arranged pores in 7-12 (generally 8) transverse rows; pores small, subcircular in the two or three proximal rows, increasing gradually in size and becoming hexagonal in shape distally, pores of each row approximately equal in size, terminal row of pores generally smaller.  A nearly flat or widely inflated, truncate-conical, latticed, abdominal brim, slightly convex outward, separated from the thorax by a distinct angular contour change occupied by an inner septal ring; pores of brim slightly smaller but similar to thoracic pores, arranged hexagonally in transverse rows (5-8 or more).  Four collar pores present; a pair of pores corresponding to jugular pores at top of dorsal face of thorax on either side of the dorsal thoracic rib; secondary lateral bars present as ribs occupying the dorsal portion of the collar stricture; they do not extend as free spines; primary lateral and dorsal bars extend as thoracic ribs for a distance of 2-6 rows of thoracic pores and in many specimens terminate in thin, conical spines.

	Measurements; based on 30 specimens from stations 27, 34, 91, 133, 136, 184, and 191: length of test (4 specimens) 68-98 µm, of cephalis 12-20 µm, of apical spine 6-31 µm, of vertical spine 6-25 µm, of primary lateral and dorsal spines 4-18 µm;  breadth of cephalis 15-20 µm, of thorax 80-l38 µm, of abdominal brim 139-289 µm.

	Remarks.  This species differs from Coracalyptra cervus (Ehrenberg) from the Gulf in the much broader and flatter abdominal brim, a more constant number (generally 8) of transverse rows of thoracic pores, more regular pores of both thorax and brim, the lack of a forked apical horn, the presence of thinner apical and vertical spines, the lack of lateral cephalic spines, a smaller length and greater breadth, the presence of dorsal and primary lateral thoracic ribs, and in general a more delicate test.  These two species appear to be closely related and should be placed within a single genus.  The extension from the collar ring of the dorsal and primary lateral bars as either free spines or thoracic ribs is subject to intraspecific variation.  In T. tricostatum the presence of thoracic ribs is constant, whereas in C. cervus, either free spines from the collar ring or thoracic ribs are present in different individuals.

	Distribution.  This species is cosmopolitan in the Gulf, being absent only at stations 90, 130, 194, 203, and 21.4.  It is common at stations 81 (2.6%), 106 (3.2%) where it is the fifth most abundant species, and 206 (2.1%) in the northern shelf region of the Gulf near a diatomite facies.  It is nearly common but rare at stations 91, 93, and 115, and rare at all others.  Except at station 81 its average frequency in the southern half of the Gulf is less than that in the northern half, a fact which indicates that it does respond to upwelling in the latter region.  Its high frequency at station 208 may be explained in part by this as well as the smaller number of species present at this station.  Its absence or very rare occurrence at marginal stations and at stations in the northern shelf region removed from diatom-rich sediments indicates its preference for more nearly oceanic, offshore waters.  It does not respond to upwelling in the southern half of the Gulf, although its high frequency at Station 81 may be explained by this but more likely by its being a common member of the oceanic waters overlying this station.
	Haeckel (1887, p. 1322) reported this species from the surface of the central Pacific at "Challenger" stations 260-274.  Popofsky (1913, p. 376) reported this species from the western tropical part of the Indian Ocean and from the southern Atlantic off the west coast of South Africa at water depths of 400 meters and 200 meters, respectively.  It appears that this species is widespread in Recent tropical seas.

<de_description><![CDATA[Tholospyris gephyristes:
The shell consists of bilocular cephalis with unequal, rounded pores and a small, fenestrated conical cupola which is prolonged into an apical spine. Three basal feet are prolongations of the dorsal and the paired lateral spines of the inner skeleton. Between their proximal portions a small amount of lattice-work connecting the spines may be present. From the lower part of the sagittal ring, where it is incorporated in the shell wall, arises a small vertical spine. There is a spine in the sagittal constriction on the dorsal side right below the cupola, like an elongation of the sagittal ring to the dorsal side. Another spine arises above the sagittal constriction on the ventral side; this spine does not originate in the constriction, but from a columella bridging the shallow groove. Haeckel (1887) shows a similar slender, bridge-like columella on the ventral side of T. tripodiscus (Pl. 89, Fig. 1), but no spine originate from there. Further, the insignificant cupola and small size of the new species, which is only about one-third of T. tripodiscus, distinguish the two species.

Dimensions. Two specimens: height of sagittal ring 0.032, 0.035mm; length of cephalis 0.044, 0.047mm. ]]></de_description>

Verticillata hexacantha Popofsky

Verticillata hexacantha Popofsky, 1913, Deutsche Südpolar-Exped., vol. 14, pp. 282-283, text-fig. 11.

	Test consisting of a single, large, lobate, campanulate joint corresponding to the cephalis; the surface of this joint with scattered short spines merges with the three, equally disposed, equal basal feet which extend from the dorsal and primary lateral bars, although in a few specimens an indistinct constriction separates the feet from the test; the upper surface of the cephalis merges with the long, proximally latticed, centrally located, vertical to curved, three-bladed apical horn.  A three-bladed vertical horn with slight downward curvature extends from the long, thin, cylindrical, internal vertical bar.  Lattice of the test very irregular, consisting of relatively small, unequal pores; outline of test irregular, with irregular lobes separated by thin ribs in the wall of the test; the ribs correspond to the apical-lateral arches and a rib lying in the sagittal plane and joining the apical horn with the dorsal foot.  Median bar lies in the approximate plane of the basal mouth of the test; the dorsal and primary lateral bars extend as ribs in the flat, latticed, inner sides of the hollow, proximally latticed, convex outward feet which have solid, three-bladed terminations.  The apical bar is a centrally located, thin, cylindrical colurnella with two to three verticils of three branches, each branch joining with one of the thin ribs in the wall of the cephalis.  Two to three verticils of paired, outward divergent spines lying in the approximate curved plane of the basal mouth and joining with its margin (collar ring) are present on the long, thin, cylindrical, dorsal and primary lateral bars.

	Measurements; based on 6 specimens from stations 27, 34, 60, and 115: maximum length of test including apical horn and feet 221-277 µm; maximum breadth of cephalis 92-111 µm, between outer margins of feet 123-135 µm; length of cephalis (from median bar to base of solid portion of apical horn) 68-98 µm, of apical horn 50-90 µm, of vertical horn 30-40 µm, of feet 74-123 µm.

	Remarks.  This species is identical with Popofskys illustration and description of Verticillata hexacantha Popofsky (1913, pp. 282-283, text fig. 11) except for the lack of the ventral sagittal spine.  This spine was not observed in any of the Gulf specimens, and its presence in the single specimen described by Popofsky may have been misinterpreted by him.  His illustration does not show it originating from the median bar; it appears to represent an accessory spine originating from the right primary lateral foot.

	Distribution.  In the Gulf this species is very rare but occurs as far north as station 184.  It is absent at stations 27, 90, 95, 130, 133, 136, and all those north of station 184.  Its more general occurrence and slightly higher frequency in the southern Gulf indicates its greater affinity for oceanic than for Gulf waters.  
	Popofsky (1913, p. 283) reported this species from the southern tropical Atlantic, near the west coast of South Africa.  Its apparent absence from high latitudes indicates that it is a tropical and possibly temperate species, present in at least the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

Zygocircus productus Hertwig (Bütschli)

Lithocircus productus Hertwig, 1879, Der Organismus der Radiolarien, p.197, Pl. 7, fig. 4.
Zygocircus (Bütschli 1881) productus Hertw. sp. [sic]; Bütschli, 1882a, Zeitschr. wiss. Zool., vol. 36, p. 496; 1882b, Klassen und Ordnungen des Thier-Reichs, vol. 1, pt. 1, Pl. 28, fig. 9.

	Test a single sagittal ring, ovoid to subpolygonal in outline, with a straight vertical bar, a straight or convex outward apical bar, and a curved or angulated superior bar.  Median bar short, cylindrica1, with six short, thorn-like, basal spines consisting of the axial, primary and secondary lateral and dorsal spines.  Bars of the ring three-bladed in section; sagittal blade without secondary spines, lateral blades with 10-20 regularly disposed, blade-like to conical spines. A short thorn-like vertical spine or thorn extends from the vertical bar; apical spine, when present, of variable length, extends from the apical bar.

	Measurements; based on 30 specimens from stations 92, 93, 106, 115, 133, and 136: maximum height of ring 79-186 µm, maximum breadth 56-113 µm, length of apical spine 0-72 µm, of vertical spine 5-14 µm, of dorsal spine 3-26 µm, of axial spine 1-10 µm, of secondary spines arising from the ring 5-30 µm.

	Remarks.  Hertwig's illustration (1879, Pl. 7, fig. 4) of Lithocircus productus shows only four basal spines arising from the median bar instead of six.  These include the axial spine, one primary and one secondary lateral spine, and the dorsal spine.  The other two spines apparently were overlooked.  A straight vertica1 bar and the apical and vertica1 spines also are not apparent in his illustration, but again these are easily overlooked.

	Distribution. This species is cosmopolitan but rare in the Gulf.  It is absent at stations 90, 99, 130, 184, 191, 203, 206, and 214.  It has a slightly greater frequency in the central part of the Gulf, namely at stations 81, 91, 106, 115, and 136, a fact which may reflect its response to upwelling.  It is very rare in the southern third of the Gulf.  It is very rare in the northern third of the Gulf and, therefore, is not very tolerant of the higher than average salinities and temperatures there.
	Haeckel (1887, p. 948) reports this species as cosmopolitan, occuring at the surface in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans as well as in the Mediterranean Sea.  It has not been reported from high latitudes.
